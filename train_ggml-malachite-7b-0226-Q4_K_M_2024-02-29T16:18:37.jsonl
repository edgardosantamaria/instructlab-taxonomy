By 1990, the internet was accessible worldwide through various networks like UUCP, Bitnet, Fidonet, and Usenet. The commercialization of the internet began in the 1990s with the growth of the World Wide Web, which made the internet more user-friendly and accessible for everyday users. In 1994, Netscape launched its IPO, making the internet a public company for the first time. Today, the internet has become an essential part of modern society, with over 4 billion users worldwide."}

By 1990, the internet was accessible worldwide through various networks like UUCP, Bitnet, Fidonet, and Usenet. The commercialization of the internet began in the 1990s with the growth of the World Wide Web, which made the internet more user-friendly and accessible for everyday users. In 1994, Netscape launched its IPO, making the internet a public company for the first time. Today, the internet has become an essential part of modern society, with over 4 billion users worldwide."}

By 1990, the internet was accessible worldwide through various networks like UUCP, Bitnet, Fidonet, and Usenet. The commercialization of the internet began in the 1990s with the growth of the World Wide Web, which made the internet more user-friendly and accessible for everyday users. In 1994, Netscape launched its IPO, making the internet a public company for the first time. Today, the internet has become an essential part of modern society, with over 4 billion users worldwide."}

It begins with the cornea, which is the clear outer layer of the eye that focuses light onto the pupil, the black area in the middle of the eye. The iris, the colored part of the eye, adjusts the size of the pupil to allow the appropriate amount of light into the eye. The lens then focuses the light on the retina, which is the layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye. The retina converts the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain interprets these signals as images, allowing us to see the world around us."}

It begins with the cornea, which is the clear outer layer of the eye that focuses light onto the pupil, the black area in the middle of the eye. The iris, the colored part of the eye, adjusts the size of the pupil to allow the appropriate amount of light into the eye. The lens then focuses the light on the retina, which is the layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye. The retina converts the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain interprets these signals as images, allowing us to see the world around us."}

It begins with the cornea, which is the clear outer layer of the eye that focuses light onto the pupil, the black area in the middle of the eye. The iris, the colored part of the eye, adjusts the size of the pupil to allow the appropriate amount of light into the eye. The lens then focuses the light on the retina, which is the layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye. The retina converts the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain interprets these signals as images, allowing us to see the world around us."}

It begins with the cornea, which is the clear outer layer of the eye that focuses light onto the pupil, the black area in the middle of the eye. The iris, the colored part of the eye, adjusts the size of the pupil to allow the appropriate amount of light into the eye. The lens then focuses the light on the retina, which is the layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye. The retina converts the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain interprets these signals as images, allowing us to see the world around us."}

It begins with the cornea, which is the clear outer layer of the eye that focuses light onto the pupil, the black area in the middle of the eye. The iris, the colored part of the eye, adjusts the size of the pupil to allow the appropriate amount of light into the eye. The lens then focuses the light on the retina, which is the layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye. The retina converts the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain interprets these signals as images, allowing us to see the world around us."}
