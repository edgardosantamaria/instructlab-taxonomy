- question: 'how many days between Feb 1 and Mar 1?'
  answer: >-
    The number of days between February 1 and March 1 depends on whether February
    is a leap year or not. In a regular year, there are 28 days in February, so
    the total number of days between February 1 and March 1 would be 28 (February
    1 to February 28) plus 1 (March 1), which equals 29 days. However, in a leap
    year, February has 29 days, so the total number of days between February 1
    and March 1 would be 29 (February 1 to February 29) plus 1 (March 1), which equals 30 days.

- question: 'What is the number of days between Sep 19 and Oct 3, inclusive?'
  answer: >-
    There are fifteen days between September 19th and October 3rd, inclusive. To calculate this,
    we start by finding the difference in days between September 19th and September 30th (inclusive),
    which is 12 days. Then, we add 3 to account for October 1st to October 3rd.
    Therefore, there are a total of 15 days between these two dates.
