seed_examples:
  - answer: The word 'find' appears 2 times in the text.
    context: >-
      Analogy - find and fix a bug in the model’s capabilities. Find something
      the model does poorly.
    question: How many times is the word find used in the following text
  - answer: The word 'word' appears 2 times in the text.
    context: >-
      Although it is impossible to predict word boundaries from stress alone in
      languages with phonemic stress, there will be just one syllable with
      primary stress per word, which allows for determining the total number of
      words in an utterance.
    question: How many occurrences of the word word are in the text?
  - answer: The word 'stress' appears 0 times in the text.
    context: >-
      Many phonological rules operate only within a phonological word or
      specifically across word boundaries.
    question: Tell the occurrences of the word stress in the text.
  - answer: The word 'a' appears 9 times in the text.
    context: >-
      A disyllabic verb root may take a zero suffix, e.g. luwa-ø 'hit!', but a
      monosyllabic root must take a suffix, e.g. ya-nta 'go!', thus conforming
      to a segmental pattern of Walmatjari words. In the Pitjantjatjara dialect
      of the Wati language, another language form Australia, a word-medial
      syllable can end with a consonant but a word-final syllable must end with
      a vowel.
    question: Tell the occurrences of the word 'a' in the text.
  - answer: The word 'the' appears 4 times in the text.
    context: >-
      Much of the difficulty stems from the eurocentric bias, as languages from
      outside of Europe may not follow the intuitions of European scholars. Some
      of the criteria developed for 'word' can only be applicable to languages
      of broadly European synthetic structure. Because of this unclear status,
      some linguists propose avoiding the term 'word' altogether, instead
      focusing on better defined terms such as morphemes.
    question: Count the occurrences of the word 'the' in the text.
