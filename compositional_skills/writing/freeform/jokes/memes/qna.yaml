      I have made a risky deployment of software without testing it. I want to
      let off steam with my colleagues by using a meme. Which one should I use?

      You could use the "Most Interesting Man In The World" meme, where a
      charismatic man speaks about his tastes. The label could be "I don't
      always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production".

      I'm supposed to do my homework but I'd rather play online with my friends,
      what meme should I use to let them know I'm always available?

      You could use the "Exit 12" meme, where a car aggressively exists the

      with you".

      What meme should I use when I have something boring I have committed to do

      You could use the "Distracted Boyfriend" meme where a couple walks down
      the street and the boyfriends turns back and looks at a woman passing by.

      the task you have committed to do, and the passing by woman would be
      labeled as the exciting thing you'd rather do.

      I pulled the fire alarm at school to avoid a test, what's the best meme to
      send to my friends?
    answer: >-
      The most appropriate meme would be "Disaster Girl", where a young girl
      looks back at the camera with a burning house at the back. You could label
      the girl "Me" and the building "School", or edit a picture of you on the
      girl's face.
