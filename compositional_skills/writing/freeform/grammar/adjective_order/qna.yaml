  - question: Explain the order of the adjectives in "little black wolf"
    answer: >
      The adjectives "little" and "black" appear in the order of size (little)
      followed by colour (black), which is a common order in English adjective
      placement.
  - question: Explain the order of the adjectives in "big bad wolf"
    answer: >
      The adjectives "big" and "bad" appear in the order of an "I" vowel (big)
      followed by an "A" vowel (bad), in a pair of near-identical words. This
      rule is know as ablaut reduplication and refers to a vowel change which,
      in reduplicates (sequences of two or three near-identical words), often
      follows a particular vowel pattern, such as zigzag or sing-song. If there
      are two words, the first vowel is I and the second is usually either A or
      O.

      Ablaut reduplication takes precedence over the common order in English
      adjective placement.

      adjective placement.
  - question: Explain the order of the adjectives in "bad little black Carpathian wolf"
    answer: >
      The adjectives "bad", "little", "black", and Carpathian appear in the
      order of opinion (bad) followed by size (little) followed by colour
      (black) followed by origin (Carpathian), which is a common order in
      English adjective placement.
