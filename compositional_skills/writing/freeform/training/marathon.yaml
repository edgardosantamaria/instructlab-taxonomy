      For a beginner aiming to run a marathon in six months, consider the following training schedule:
      - Week 1-4: Build endurance with 3-4 short runs (3-5 miles) and one long run (6-8 miles) per week.
      - Week 5-8: Increase mileage with 4-5 short runs (4-6 miles) and one long run (8-10 miles) per week.
      - Week 9-12: Add speed work with intervals and maintain a long run of 10-12 miles.
      - Week 13-16: Focus on hill training and increase long run to 14-16 miles.
      - Week 17-20: Taper down mileage but maintain intensity.
      - Week 21-24: Final taper and prepare mentally for the marathon.

      For an intermediate runner aiming to improve their marathon time, consider incorporating the following key workouts:
      - Tempo runs at a pace slightly faster than marathon pace.
      - Long runs with progression, gradually increasing pace.
      - Interval training with 800m to 1-mile repeats.
      - Back-to-back long runs to simulate race fatigue.
