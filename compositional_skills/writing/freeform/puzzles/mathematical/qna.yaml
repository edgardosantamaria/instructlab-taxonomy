    The entire 5cm of the eraser is left. Using half of the pencil does not
    affect the length of the eraser. So, if the eraser was 5 cm long to begin
    with, it remains 5 cm long regardless of how much of the pencil is used.

    '
  question: A pencil is 15 cm long, including a 5 cm eraser. If you use half of the
    pencil, how much eraser is left?

    Given it takes 20 minutes to fill the bathtub with both the hot and cold taps
    open, and both taps have the same flow rate, then each tap alone
    contributes half the flow needed to fill the tub. Therefore, if only the
    hot tap is open, it will take twice as long to fill the tub since only one
    of the two sources of water is being used. So, it will take 40 minutes to
    fill the tub with just the hot tap open.

    '
  question: If it takes 20 minutes to fill a bathtub with both the hot and cold taps
    open, how long will it take to fill the tub if you open only the hot tap,
    assuming it has the same flow rate as the cold tap?

    Let us say Alice age is A and Bob age is B. As per given information, 10
    years ago Alice age was A-10 and Bob age was B-10 and also A-10= 2(B-10).
    As A is 70, solving this we get B as 40. So Bob is 40 years old now.

    '
  question: Ten years ago, Alice was twice as old as Bob was. If Alice is now 70 years
    old, how old is Bob?

    Workout starting time is 1:55 PM. Workout duration is 7 minutes. So the
    workout ends after 7 minutes. Add the minutes directly to the starting
    minute count. If it exceeds 60, adjust the overflow to hours. Since adding
    7 minutes to 1:55 brings us past the hour, 1 hour changes to 2. 1:55 + 7
    minutes is 2:02 PM.

    '
  question: You start a 7-minute workout at 1:55 PM. What time does it end?
