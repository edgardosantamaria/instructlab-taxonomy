  - question: How do you light a fire in a wood burning stove?
    answer: >
      Start by opening the damper.  If your stove has a catalytic converter make
      sure it is not engaged.  Place four crumpled up pieces of paper and then
      place kindling on top of it in a "log cabin" formation.  The first few
      layers should be small at first, thumb size and smaller.  Place two wrist
      sized logs on top of the kindling.  Once that is fully enflamed, you can
      add two more larger pieces of wood on top.  Make sure they are fully on
      fire before closing your stove's door.
  - question: How do I prevent smoke from coming into my house while lighting?
    answer: >
      Make sure the flue is open and if you have a catalytic converter, make
      sure it is off.  While lighting, crack a window.  Also, you can "prime"
      the flue.  If you have a welding torch you can heat the top of your stove
      for 20-30 seconds.  This gets the cold air stuck in the chimney moving
      upwards.  Also, make sure you are using very dry hard wood and that it is
      smaller pieces.  The larger pieces take a while and they smoke while
      coming up to temperature.
  - question: How do I keep my glass clean?
    answer: >
      If you have a temperature control on your stove, make sure not to close
      off oxygen to the fire before the fireplace *and* the wood have come up to
      temperature.  If you do so, the wood will start to burn uncleanly and will
      deposit on the stove.  If fully loading the stove, this can take up to 45
      minutes for the inner parts of the wood and stove to come up to temp even
      if the outside of them is on fire.
  - question: How do I restart a fire once it has burned down to coals?
    answer: >
      As a fireplace cools, it is easier to get going again than doing it from
      a cold start, but overloading the stove too early can generate a
      significant smoke event.  First rake the coals to the front of the stove.
      Then put one or two smaller pieces of wood in, no thicker than wrist
      size.  Use a bellows to get the coals extra hot and don't add more wood
      until the wrist thick pieces of wood are on fire.  If the coals aren't
      actively red, you may have to use even smaller pieces of kindling.
  - question: How can I preserve wood?
      If you are actively trying to preserve wood, consider burning the stove
      cooler than normal and adding only a couple of pieces of wood at a time.
      Also consider getting very dense hard woods like an oak, maple, or
      cherry.
