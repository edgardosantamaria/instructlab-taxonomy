      Let's assume that you're familiar with how to read the treble clef. It has
      five lines in a stave and the note on the lowest line is an "e". Now, the
      bass clef also has 5 lines in a stave but the note on the lowest line is a
      "g". That said, when reading the bass clef you can simply think of the
      note name in the treble clef that's two lines higher in the stave. For
      example, the note name between the bottom two lines in the bass clef has
      the same name as the note between the second and third line in the treble
      clef, namely "a".
    question: 'How can I learn how to read the bass clef?'
