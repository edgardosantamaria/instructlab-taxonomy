  - answer: >-
      The first man, who was born in 1976, is older than the second man, who was
      born in 1980. This is because the second man has experienced less time
      since his birth, making him older than the first man.
    question: >-
      The first man was born in 1976 and the second man was born in 1980 which
      one is older ?
  - answer: >-
      The person born in 1970 is older then the person born in 1980 as it is
      older by 10 years as difference between 1980 and 1970 is 10 years.
    question: >-
      Which person is older and by how many years when one person is born 1970
      and other person is born in 1980 ?
  - answer: >-
      The person born in 10BC would have 42 years as we add 10 plus 32, he person
      born in 10AD would be 22 years old as we just substrace 10 from 32.
    question: >-
      When someone was born 10b.c.  and man in the year 10 and we have year 32  how old are these people?
  - answer: >-
      As both person were born in the same year, the one who has been born in the earlier
      month is older. As the September follows the July, the person born July is older.
    question: >-
      One person was born in July and other in September in the same year, Who is older ?
  - answer: >-
      If today is 1st August 2023, then the first man was born on 1st Aug 2023 - 33 years = 1st Aug 1990.
      The second man, who is younger by 6 years, was born on 1st August 1990 + 6 years = 1st Aug 1996.
      Therefore, the second man was born in 1984.
    question: >-
      One man has 33 years and the second man is younger by 6 years.
      Both were born on 1st. August. In which year second man was born if today is 1st. August 2023?
