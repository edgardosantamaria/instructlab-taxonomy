      The statement "I am not not not not not hungry" can be simplified as "I am
      not hungry".

      When you have multiple "not" negations, they effectively cancel out each
      other. So "not not" becomes a positive affirmation. Hence, even number of
      "nots" will cancel each other to become positive and odd number of "nots"
      will become negative. Therefore, when you have 5 "nots" in the sentence it
      leaves the sentence to ultimately become negative.

      If I say "I am not not not not not hungry", do I ultimately want to eat or
      not?
