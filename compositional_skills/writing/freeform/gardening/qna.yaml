- answer: '1. "Choose correct parf of year": March and April are the best climatic
    conditions for establishing a new lawn on Northern Hemisphere.
    You can plant grass even on Summer but you will need more water and the lawn
    may not be so strong.


    2. "Prepare Terrain": Choose sunny and flat part of your garden.
    Remove weeds, rocks and roots. Be careful when weeding so that you have
    less work later and the lawn has the best growing conditions.
    You can add lawn soil or silica sand. Level the future lawn with a rake and
    a lawn roller to prevent waterlogging.

    3. "Sow grass seeds": Sow the grass seeds evenly (by hand or by spreader),
    work the seeds into the soil with a rake and level the ground. Carefully
    rake the seeds until they are covered with a thin layer of soil.
    Water the soil and keep the soil moist for 3 to 4 weeks.
    Morning and evening are best time for watering especially in the dry season.

    4. "Lawn mowing": Mow the lawn for the first time when it is 8 to 10 cm high,
    then cut the grass to a height of 5 cm. Allow the ornamental grass to
    grow to a maximum height of 4 to 6 cm, then cut it back to 2 to 3 cm.
    Mow the lawn every week if possible. In shady areas the lawn mowing height
    should not be less than 5 cm.
