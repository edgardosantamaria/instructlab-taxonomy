      Classic Recipe for Pesto

      Ingredients:

      * 4 oz (100 g) fresh basil

      * About 8 oz (200 g) extra virgin olive oil

      * ⅓ cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese or a
      1:1 mixture.

      * ¼ cup pine nuts or nut of choice (optional)

      * 4 cloves garlic

      * Freshly ground salt and pepper (to taste)

      Procedure:

      1. Preheat the oven to 425 °F (220 °C).

      2. If using, toast the pine nuts in an ovenproof pan for 10–15 minutes,
      checking every 5 minutes to prevent excessive browning or burning.

      3. In a small frying pan (skillet), heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil on medium
      heat.

      4. Crush the garlic and sauté in the oil until soft, about 2–3 minutes.

      5. Combine the basil, garlic, cheese, pine nuts and oil in a mortar and
      pestle until it forms a smooth paste, or use a food processor or blender
      and chop finely, slowly adding the oil to reach the paste-like
      consistency.
