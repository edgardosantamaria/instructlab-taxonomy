    question: what's the race calendar for f1 in 2024?
  - answer: |
      1. Review Time Periods: Teams now have a shorter window of four days to
        appeal decisions, with potential for a 24-hour extension in special
        cases. They must pay a deposit, specify significant elements, and
        adhere to new hearing protocols.
      2. Increase in Potential Fines: Maximum fines for rule violations
        quadrupled to €1 million, applying to both teams and drivers,
        with other categories also seeing adjustments due to a decade-long
        stagnation.
      3. F1 Sprint Format Tweak: The F1 Sprint format returns with slight
        modifications, moving Sprint Qualifying from Saturday to Friday,
        followed by the 100km Sprint on Saturday and Grand Prix qualifying
        later the same day.
      4. Bigger Promotional Events: Teams can now run double the mileage
        (200km) during promotional events, enhancing pre-season shakedowns
        and footage capture.
      5. Changes to Testing Old Cars: Clarifications to Testing of Previous
        Car (TPC) program mandate that all components must have prior official
        testing or race weekend usage, preventing crossover with current car
        development.
      6. Increased CapEx Limits: Teams can now spend more on Capital
        Expenditure (CapEx) over a four-year period, aiming to bridge
        the gap between leading and trailing teams.
      7. Even More Strict Roll Hoop Requirements: Following Zhou Guanyu's
        2022 British Grand Prix crash, roll hoops must withstand stricter
        load tests, enhancing safety measures.
      8. Plan for Wheel Displays Dropped: Originally intended for 2024,
        the inclusion of rotating displays within wheel covers was retracted
        from regulations, impacting aerodynamics and weight limits.
      9. DRS Activation: DRS activation during races now anticipates to one
        lap, changing from the previous two laps after race starts or
        Safety Car restarts.
