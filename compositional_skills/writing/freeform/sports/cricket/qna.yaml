      Cricket law 38.3.1 At any time from the moment the ball comes into play
      until the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to

      of his/her ground. In these circumstances the non-striker will be out Run
      out if he/she is out of his/her ground when his/her wicket is broken by

      the ball, whether or not the ball is subsequently delivered.
