- answer: "To make a pizza large enough for a standard baking tray, you need:
    Flour, 500 gr
    Water ~260 ml
    brewer's yeast 25 gr
    tomato sauce, at least 500 gr
    mozzarella cheese, at least 300 gr
    extra virgin olive oil
    oregano
    salt
    basil

    Put the flour in a large bowl, add salt ~10 gr and oil ~15 ml.
    Melt the yeast in a little lukewarm water, add it to the bowl, and
    start mixing either with a kneading machine, a large wooden spoon, or
    your hands, adding gradually the remaining water until the dough
    becomes soft, compact and almost don't attach your hands anymore.
    You can add a little more flour and/or a little more water as needed to
    obtain the right consistency.

    Cover the bowl with a cloth and let the dough rise for at least 2 hours.
    The more the better up to half a day.

    Cover the baking tray with baking paper and roll out the dough with a
    rolling pin to cover the whole surface. The dough has to be thin, at
    most 5mm in height.

    Put the tomato sauce in another bowl add salt ~5gr, oil ~10ml and oregano
    according to your taste. Mix them and cover the dough leaving a small gap at
    the edge.

    Bake in the oven at 220 degrees centigrade. After 6-7 minutes add the
    mozzarella cheese, cut into very small pieces, to cover the tomato sauce.
    Keep cooking until the cheese is melted and the dough becomes crispy.

    Add some basil leaves on top."
