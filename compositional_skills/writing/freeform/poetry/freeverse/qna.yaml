- answer: 'In the waning days of summer''s reign,

    A subtle shift begins to stir.

    Nature dons her cloak of flame,

    As autumn leaves awaken to their metamorphosis.


    Crimson and gold, hues of amber,

    In every corner, a vibrant display.

    Leaves whisper tales of time,

    Of seasons turning, in their gentle way.


    Beneath the azure sky, they dance,

    A ballet of light and shadow.

    Each leaf, a fleeting sonnet,

    Penned by the hand of autumn''s glow.


    They rustle in the cool, crisp air,

    A symphony of colors bold.

    In their fiery beauty, a secret lies,

    A testament to life''s enduring hold.


    As the days grow short and cold,

    The leaves surrender to the breeze.

    In their descent, a final verse,

    A poignant ode to autumn''s ease.


    In the aftermath, a quiet stillness,

    Nature''s canvas now bereft of hue.

    Yet, in the heart of winter''s slumber,

    The promise of springtime breaks anew.'

- answer: 'Far across the hills, the sun rises,

    with golden rays, warming plains far and wide

    Bringing cheer to wilted blooms,

    And smiles on the faces of old and young alike


    Changing myriad colors as it drifts in the sky,

    silently creating shadows and cool shade,

    Never a moment it pauses to take a break,

    bringing light and joy to those who wait


    Sun is food, Sun is hope,

    working in step with the clock''s stroke,

    Sun is light, Sun is warmth,

    in your soothing beams we soak


    You are the creator, you are the sustainer,

    of life above and below,

    in your kindness we believe,

    To thee, a great deal we owe.'
