- answer: 'In the waning days of summer''s reign,

    A subtle shift begins to stir.

    Nature dons her cloak of flame,

    As autumn leaves awaken to their metamorphosis.


    Crimson and gold, hues of amber,

    In every corner, a vibrant display.

    Leaves whisper tales of time,

    Of seasons turning, in their gentle way.


    Beneath the azure sky, they dance,

    A ballet of light and shadow.

    Each leaf, a fleeting sonnet,

    Penned by the hand of autumn''s glow.


    They rustle in the cool, crisp air,

    A symphony of colors bold.

    In their fiery beauty, a secret lies,

    A testament to life''s enduring hold.


    As the days grow short and cold,

    The leaves surrender to the breeze.

    In their descent, a final verse,

    A poignant ode to autumn''s ease.


    In the aftermath, a quiet stillness,

    Nature''s canvas now bereft of hue.

    Yet, in the heart of winter''s slumber,

    The promise of springtime breaks anew.'

- answer: 'Far across the hills, the sun rises,

    with golden rays, warming plains far and wide

    Bringing cheer to wilted blooms,

    And smiles on the faces of old and young alike


    Changing myriad colors as it drifts in the sky,

    silently creating shadows and cool shade,

    Never a moment it pauses to take a break,

    bringing light and joy to those who wait


    Sun is food, Sun is hope,

    working in step with the clock''s stroke,

    Sun is light, Sun is warmth,

    in your soothing beams we soak


    You are the creator, you are the sustainer,

    of life above and below,

    in your kindness we believe,

    To thee, a great deal we owe.'

- answer: 'You are truly a jewel of the sky

    creating wonder in the eyes of passerby,

    Many shapes and sizes you change

    Delighting hearts of the people of any age,

    Reflecting colors like diamonds in the crown


    By you, the sheets of the town are all cooled down,

    You are my dearest friend, O'' Rain

    It is a pleasure to welcome you again and again.'

- answer: 'In the rustle of leaves,

    In the swaying of trees,

    I feel you,


    Traveling across salty seas,

    In the cool breeze,

    I feel you,


    Voyaging far off lands,

    Drawing patterns on sands,

    I see you,


    Howling along all night,

    Painting the town snow white,

    I see you,


    There is so much to you that is unknown,

    Yet I feel I know you

    and that you are my own!'

- answer: 'Appearing as miles and miles of blue,

    where the sky starts and where it ends

    there seems to be no clue,

    You are a vast expanse of mystery O'' Sea!


    Shells and pearls are not the only things you hide

    amidst corals and oysters

    that decorate your sides,

    You are an abode of treasure O'' Sea!


    Reflecting the sky''s numerous hues

    Assuming likewise several moods

    Sometimes black, sometimes orange and sometimes blue

    You are verily a painting O'' Sea!


    Home to million creatures beneath,

    Adorned with kelp and sea weed,

    Countless are the mouths that you feed

    You are world of your own O'' Sea!'
