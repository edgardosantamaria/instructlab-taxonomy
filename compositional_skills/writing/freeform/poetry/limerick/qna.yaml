  - question: Write a funny limerick
    answer: 
      Once a girl Lola lived in a Spanish town
      Clouded vision made her brows frown
      Broke a few vases,
      As she looked for her glasses
      Only to find they were on her crown!

  - question: Tell me a limerick about cats
    answer: 
      A little boy Toby once thought
      What if the cats could talk?
      Would they just bleat
      About what they get to eat?
      Or simply be lazy to even talk?

    answer: 
      Bob baked a party cake for all
      But it turned out too small
      So he made another one,
      And swiftly reached the function
      Only to trip with them over a ball!

      Little miss Muffet, sat on her tuffet
      Eating her curd and whey
