  question: Write a patter song about a military general
- answer: "
  When you're lying awake
  With a dismal headache
  And repose is taboo'd by anxiety
  I conceive you may use
  Any language you choose
  To indulge in, without impropriety;
  For your brain is on fire
  The bedclothes conspire
  Of usual slumber to plunder you:
  First your counterpane goes
  And uncovers your toes
  And your sheet slips demurely from under you;

  Then the blanketing tickles
  You feel like mixed pickles
  So terribly sharp is the pricking
  And you're hot, and you're cross
  And you tumble and toss
  Till there's nothing â€˜twixt you and the ticking
  Then the bedclothes all creep
  To the ground in a heap
  And you pick 'em all up in a tangle;
  Next your pillow resigns
  And politely declines
  To remain at its usual angle!

  Well, you get some repose
  In the form of a doze
  With hot eyeballs and head ever aching
  But your slumbering teems
  With such horrible dreams
  That you'd very much better be waking;
  For you dream you are crossing
  The Channel, and tossing
  About in a steamer from Harwich
  Which is something between
  A large bathing machine
  And a very small second-class carriage

  And you're giving a treat
  (Penny ice and cold meat)
  To a party of friends and relations
  They're a ravenous horde
  And they all came on board
  At Sloane Square and South Kensington Stations
  And bound on that journey
  You find your attorney
  (Who started that morning from Devon);
  He's a bit undersized
  And you don't feel surprised
  When he tells you he's only eleven

  Well, you're driving like mad
  With this singular lad
  (By the by, the ship's now a four-wheeler)
  And you're playing round games
  And he calls you bad names
  When you tell him that 'ties pay the dealer';
  But this you can't stand
  So you throw up your hand
  And you find you're as cold as an icicle
  In your shirt and your socks
  (The black silk with gold clocks)
  Crossing Salisbury Plain on a bicycle:

  And he and the crew
  Are on bicycles too
  Which they've somehow or other invested in
  And he's telling the tars
  All the particulars
  Of a company he's interested in
  It's a scheme of devices
  To get at low prices
  All goods from cough mixtures to cables
  (Which tickled the sailors)
  By treating retailers
  As though they were all vegetables

  You get a good spadesman
  To plant a small tradesman
  (First take off his boots with a boot-tree)
  And his legs will take root
  And his fingers will shoot
  And they'll blossom and bud like a fruit-tree
  From the greengrocer tree
  You get grapes and green pea
  Cauliflower, pineapple, and cranberries
  While the pastry-cook plant
  Cherry brandy will grant
  Apple puffs, and three corners, and Banburys

  The shares are a penny
  And ever so many
  Are taken by Rothschild and Baring
  And just as a few
  Are allotted to you
  You awake with a shudder despairing

  You're a regular wreck
  With a crick in your neck
  And no wonder you snore
  For your head's on the floor
  And you've needles and pins
  From your soles to your shins
  And your flesh is a-creep
  For your left leg's asleep
  And you've cramp in your toes
  And a fly on your nose
  And some fluff in your lung
  And a feverish tongue
  And a thirst that's intense
  And a general sense
  That you haven't been sleeping in clover;
  But the darkness has passed
  And it's daylight at last
  And the night has been long
  Ditto, ditto my song
  And thank goodness they're both of them over!"
