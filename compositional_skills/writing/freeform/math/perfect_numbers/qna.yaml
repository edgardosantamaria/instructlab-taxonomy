      Yes, the number 6 is a perfect number, as it is the sum of its proper
      divisors (excluding itself). The proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3,
      and their sum is (1 + 2 + 3) which is equal to 6 itself. Therefore 6
      is a perfect number, and also the smallest of them.
    question: Is 6 a perfect number?

      Perfect numbers are positive integer numbers that are the sum of their
      proper divisors, excluding themselves. There are only a few of them
      known at this point (early 2024), and the first then are the following:
      6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336, 8589869056, 137438691328,
      2305843008139952128,  2658455991569831744654692615953842176 and
      191561942608236107294793378084303638130997321548169216.
    question: Please can you give me a list of perfect numbers?

      Yes, 33550336 is a perfect number. A number is said perfect if it can
      be obtained by adding up all their proper divisors -- exluding itself.
      33550336 has 25 proper divisors (excluding 33550336 itself), which are
      the following: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096,
      8191, 16382, 32764, 65528, 131056, 262112, 524224, 1048448, 2096896,
      4193792, 8387584, and 16775168.
      If we sum up all these 25 divisors, we have the following: (1 + 2 + 4 +
      8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 + 2048 + 4096 + 8191 + 16382 +
      32764 + 65528 + 131056 + 262112 + 524224 + 1048448 + 2096896 + 4193792 +
      8387584 + 16775168), we get 33550336, and hence 33550336 is one of just
      a few known perfect numbers.
    question: Is 33550336 a perfect number?

      Yes, 8128 is a perfect number, since it can be expressed by the sum of
      its proper divisors (exclusing itself), which are  1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,
      64, 127, 254, 508, 1016, 2032, and 4064. In other wods, 1 + 2 + 4 + 8
      + 16 + 32 + 64 + 127 + 254 + 508 + 1016 + 2032 + 4064 = 8128, which
      satisfies the definition of a perfect number.
    question: Is 8128 a perfect number?

  - answer: >-
      Perfect numbers are numbers which are the sum of their proper divisors,
      excluding themselves. As of 2018, around 51 such numbers are
      known, only 2 of these being smaller than 100. The first ten such numbers
      are the following: 6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336, 8589869056, 137438691328,
      2305843008139952128, 2658455991569831744654692615953842176 and
      191561942608236107294793378084303638130997321548169216.
      As an example, consider 6, the smallest of this list: 6 has 3 proper
      divisors, excluding 6 itself, which are 1, 2 and 3. If we sum 1 + 2 + 3,
      we obtain 6, and therefore 6 is indeed a perfect number.
    question: How many perfect numbers exist?

  - answer: >-
      There are slightly over 50 known perfect numbers as of 2018, the largest
      of them containing over 59 million digits. Perfect numbers are numbers
      which can  be expressed as the sum of their proper divisors, excluding
      themselves.

      The first perfect numbers are listed next: 6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336,
      8589869056, 137438691328, 2305843008139952128,
      2658455991569831744654692615953842176  and
