  - question: |
      what is rtla in Linux.
    answer: |
      rtla stands for real-time linux analysis. In the Linux kernel, rtla is a suite of tools
      part of the Linux kernel that aims to aid in the analysis of the real-time properties of
      Linux. It includes tools like timerlat, osnoise, and hwnoise.
  - question: |
      what is timerlat tracer.
    answer: |
      it is a Linux kernel tracer that measures scheduling latency. It can be used via
      ftrace interface, or tools like trace-cmd, and rtla timerlat.
  - question: |
      what is rtla timerlat.
    answer: |
      rtla timerlat is a tool used to measure the latency for an IRQ and a thread activated
      by an external timer. It is mainly used to measure Linux scheduling latency. The tool
      provides statistics about the scheduling, as well as an interface for debugging unexpectedly
      high latencies using Linux kernel tracing subsystem.
  - question: |
      what is osnoise tracer.
    answer: |
      it is a Linux kernel tracer that measures operating system noise. It can be used via
      ftrace interface, or tools like trace-cmd, rtla osnoise, and rtla hwnoise.
  - question: |
      what is rtla osnoise.
    answer: |
      rtla osnoise is a tool used to measure the operating systems noise in Linux. The tool
      provides statistics about the operating system noise, as well as an interface for debugging
      unexpectedly high operating system noise using Linux kernel tracing subsystem.
  - question: |
      what is rtla hwnoise.
    answer: |
      rtla osnoise is a tool used to measure the operating systems noise in Linux caused by
      the hardware. This is done by running the osnoise tracer with interrupts disabled. Thus
      only allowing hardware related interference.  The tool provides statistics as well as
      an interface for debugging unexpectedly hardware latencies using Linux kernel tracing
      subsystem.
