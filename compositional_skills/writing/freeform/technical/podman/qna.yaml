 - answer: "Podman (the POD MANager) is a tool for managing containers and
 images, volumes mounted into those containers, and pods made from groups
 of containers. Podman runs containers on Linux, but can also be used on
 Mac and Windows systems using a Podman-managed virtual machine. Podman is
 based on libpod, a library for container lifecycle management that is also
 contained in this repository. The libpod library provides APIs for managing
 containers, pods, container images, and volumes."
   question: What is Podman?
 - answer: "Podman Desktop is a graphical interface that enables application
 developers to seamlessly work with containers and Kubernetes.

Podman Desktop installs, configures, and keeps Podman up to date on your
local environment. It provides a system tray, to check status and interact
with your container engine without losing focus from other tasks. The desktop
application provides a dashboard to interact with containers, images, pods,
and volumes but also configures your environment with your OCI registries and
network settings. Podman Desktop also provides capabilities to connect and
deploy pods to Kubernetes environments.

Podman Desktop also supports multiple container engines, pick your favourite
one and use the tool!"
