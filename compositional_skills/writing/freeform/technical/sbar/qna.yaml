    Situation: A customer has reported a critical software bug that requires
    an immediate fix to remediate a production outage.

    Background: The most recent release of our software included a number of
    bug fixes and performance enhancements. The development team performed
    numerous regression tests and performance tests before deciding that
    the software release was safe to ship to customers. However, the
    software release introduced a severe issue for certain customers
    operating in an uncommon configuration.

    Assessment: The new issue is severe enough that a workaround is not
    possible for customers and they are in an outage. We should fix this
    problem as soon as possible.

    Recommendation: We should shift resources from new feature development
    to fixing this bug.

    Situation: A patient arrived at our facility without an appointment
    and is complaining of chest pains.

    Background: The patient has not been seen by our facility before but
    noted that he was recently admitted at another hospital for a heart
    attack. His pulse is 125, his blood pressure is 110/62, and his
    breathing is shallow and rapid.

    Assessment: Given his symptoms and history, it appears he is having
    another cardiac event.

    Recommendation: We should see the patient immediately, order an EKG,
    and start an O2 feed to help with breathing.

    Situation: The electrical crew has found a problem in the framing
    of the home they are building and are concerned about the structural
    safety of the home.

    Background: The framing of the home was done by another contractor
    who completed the job weeks ago. It was a contracting outfit that
    had not been used before. They finished their work under budget and
    ahead of schedule. The electrician on site has found a number of
    problems in the framing and has raised the issue with the foreman.

    Assessment: The foreman has inspected the framing work with greater
    scrutiny and has found a number of problems with the lumber and
    hardware used during the framing process.

    Recommendation: The foreman recommends that all construction is
    halted and work is begun on repairing the faulty framing.
