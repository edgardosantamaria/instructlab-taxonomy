- answer: 'The 389 Directory Server access logs contain information
    about client requests to the server.  The logging includes timestamps,
    authentication information, client information, the LDAP operation 
    request, and result of these requests.
        
    Since the 389 Directory Server log does not follow any logging standards 
    the server ships with a tool called "/usr/bin/logconv.pl".  This tool
    has a variety of options on what and how to display statistics about the 
    access log. See the tool usage for more information about its options.
