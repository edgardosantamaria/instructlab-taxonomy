    answer:
      As the new secrets are available in the Vault server or OpenShift project's secret management, \
      we can add them as environment variables using the `secretEnvVar` to make them available for that job.
  - question: How to use the enabled secrets in the job?

    answer:
      The newly added secret is enabled for that job, and we can directly use the secret environment key in the job, \
      which gets enabled and hidden.
