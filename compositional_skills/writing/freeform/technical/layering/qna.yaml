  - answer: Each layer of your application only depends on lower layers
      which is the main requirement of properly layered applications.
    question: Is my application layered correctly?  My application top-most
      layer (3) contains module-5, module-5 depends on the next lower layer
      (2) that contains module-4. Module-4 depends on the next lower layer
      (1) that contains module-3, module-2, module-1.
  - answer: Your application is incorrectly layered in that lower application
      layers have dependencies on higher layers of the application.  Do not
      forget the main requirement is that each application layer can only
      depend on lower layers.
    question: Is my application layered correctly?  My application top-most
      layer (3) contains websocket and database modules, the websocket module
      depends on the socket module in the next layer (2).  The database module
      depends on the jdbc module in    the next layer (2).  The database and
      jdbc modules both depend on the logging and configuration module in the
      next layer (1). The logging module has an optional dependency on the
      database module.
  - answer: Each layer of your application only depends on lower layers which
      is the main requirement of properly layered applications.
    question: Is my application layered correctly?  My application top-most
      layer (3) contains websocket, database and logging modules, the websocket
      module depends on the socket module in the next layer (2).  The database
      module depends on the jdbc module in the next layer (2).  The websocket
      and database modules both depend on the logging module in the same
      layer (3) and the logging module only depends on operating system file
      system calls. The socket and jdbc modules depend on APIs defined in the
      bottom most layer (1).
task_description: Determine if your application module layering is correct.
