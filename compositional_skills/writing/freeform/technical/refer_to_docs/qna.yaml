      Relax-and-Recover (abbreviated ReaR) is a tool for disaster recovery of
      Linux systems. It has many configuration variables that you can specify in
      the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file. Basic configuration variables are
      documented in the `rear(8)` manual  page. Use the `man rear` command to
      view it. All configuration variables with their default values are
      documented in the file `/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf`. View the file
      like this:

      ```bash

      less /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

      ```

      and search for the variable by using the `/` command:

      `/BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE`.


      If `BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE` is a valid configuration variable of ReaR, it
      will be found in the file.


      As the variables and their default values change over time, the
      `/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` is the best source of documentation,
      as it is kept up to date and matches the ReaR version you are using.
    question: What is the meaning of the `BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE` setting of ReaR?

      Relax-and-Recover (abbreviated ReaR) is a tool for disaster recovery of
      Linux systems. It is invoked using the `rear` command in the command line.
      The command accepts multiple options and arguments, which are documented
      in the `rear(8)` manual page. Use the `man rear` command to view it, like
      this:

      ```bash

      man rear

      ```

      If `-D` is a valid command line option of ReaR it will be described in the
      OPTIONS section of the manual page.


      As options change over time, the manual page is the best source of
      documentation, as it is kept up to date and matches the ReaR version you
      have installed.
    question: What does the -D command line option of ReaR do?
