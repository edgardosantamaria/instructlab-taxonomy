    Leading zeros MUST be suppressed. "2001:0db8::0001" is not acceptable and must be represented
    as "2001:db8::1"
  question: >
    How do I represent an address where some 16-bit groups have leading zeros?
- answer: >
    The use of the symbol "::" MUST be used to its maximum capability. For example,
    2001:db8:0:0:0:0:2:1 must be shortened to 2001:db8::2:1.
  question: >
    How many groups can be shortened using the symbol "::"?
- answer: >
    The symbol "::" is used to suppress more than one 16-bit groups made of zeros. The symbol "::"
    MUST NOT be used to shorten just one 16-bit group.
  question: >
    What is the purpose of symbol "::"?
