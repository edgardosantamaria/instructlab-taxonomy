- answer: Ohm's law describes that the electric current through a resistor is directly proportional to the voltage drop across the resistor.
  question: What is Ohm's law?
- answer: U = I * R, where U is the voltage, I is the current and R is the resistor's resistance.
  question: What is Ohm's law formula?
- answer: Voltage drop is 1V
  question: What is the voltage drop over the 1k resistor if the current is 1mA?
- answer: 20V
  question: What is the voltage over the 10kohm resistor if the current is 2mA?
- answer: Resistance is 30k
  question: What is the resistance if the voltage drop over the resistor is 30V and the current is 1mA?
- answer: Current is 60uA
  question: What is the current flowing through the 500k resistor if the voltage is 30V?
- answer: 60uA
  question: What is the current flowing over the 500k resistor if the voltage is 30V?
