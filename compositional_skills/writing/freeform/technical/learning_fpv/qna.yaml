  - question: What is FPV?
    answer: |
      First of all decide what you want out of FPV? Are you interested in
      filming cinematic footage from your flights or are you interested in
      racing? Maybe acrobatics? Something else?
  - question: How do I get started in FPV?
    answer: |
      One method is to buy a beginner low budget drone kit that comes with
      goggles, controller, and the drone itself.

      Another option is to build your drone yourself!  Either way, the first
      thing recommended is to get into a simulator on your computer or games
      console and learn to fly in there, it'll be much cheaper for your wallet!
  - question: Is FPV expensive?
    answer: |
      Like all things in life, it can be done on a budget or the sky is the
      limit, but expect to spend around a few hundred dollars at least.
  - question: What are the two main types of FPV protocol?
    answer: |
      The proprietary Crossfire by Team Black Sheep, or the OpenSource ELRS
      are the most popular.
