  - answer: >
      To convert the text result message "Remote Code Execution" to the SARIF
      format, use the following Python script as a starting point:

      ```python

      def convert_text_message_to_sarif(text_message):
          sarif_message = {
              "version": "2.1.0",
              "runs": [
                  {
                      "tool": {
                           "driver": {
                               "name": "scanner1",
                               "version": "1.0.0"
                           }
                      },
                      "results": [
                          {
                              "message": "Remote Code Execution",
                              "level": "warning",
                              "locations": {
                                  "physicalLocation": {
                                      "artifactLocation": {
                                          "uri": "file:///path/to/your/python/codebase"
                                      },
                                      "region" {
                                          "startLine": 1,
                                          "endLine": 43,
                                          "snippet": {
                                              "text": "os.system(user_input)\n\n"
                                          }
                                      }
                                  }
                              }
                          }
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }
          return sarif_message
      ```

      Replace `"message": ""` with the desired text message, such as "Remote
      Code Execution". The resulting SARIF message can be used to represent the
      security issue in the SARIF format. Keep in mind that this is just a basic
      example, and the actual conversion process might be more complex depending
      on the specific text result message format and the desired SARIF format
      version. Also, the SARIF specification is continuously evolving, so it's
      essential to stay updated on the latest version and its requirements when
      working with SARIF data.
