- question: How to start a VM in OpenShift Virtualization ?
  answer: |
    You can start a virtual machine (VM) in OpenShift Virtualization,
    either through the web console or the command line.
    If you're using the command line, use the `virtctl` provided by Red Hat.
    Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:
    1. Access your OpenShift cluster:
       Ensure you have access to your OpenShift cluster, either through the web console or the command line.
       If you're using the command line, log in with the `oc login` command.
    2. Switch to the correct project:
       Use the `oc project` command to switch to the project where your VM is located.
    3. List available VMs:
       Type `oc get vm` to view a list of available VMs in your project.
    4. Start the VM:
       To start a specific VM, use the `virtctl start` command followed by the name of the VM.
       For example, `virtctl start myvm`.
    5. Verify the status:
       After starting the VM, use the `oc get vm` command to check its status.
       It should now show as `Running`.

    Here's an example of starting a VM named `myvm`:

      oc project myproject
      oc get vm
      virtctl start myvm

    Keep in mind that the exact commands and syntax might vary depending on your OpenShift version and configuration.
    Always consult the official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

       It should change from `Stopped` to `Starting`, then it shows as `Running`.

    Here's an example of restarting a VM named `myvm`:

      oc project myproject
      oc get vm
      virtctl restart myvm

       Type `oc get vm` to view a list of available VMs in your project.
    4. Pause the VM:
       To pause a specific VM, use the `virtctl pause` command followed by the name of the VM.
       For example, `virtctl pause vm myvm`.
    5. Verify the status:
       After pausing the VM, use the `oc get vm` command to check its status.
       It should change to `Paused`.

    Here's an example to pause a VM named `myvm`:

      oc project myproject
      oc get vm
      virtctl pause vm myvm

       To unpause a specific VM, use the `virtctl unpause` command followed by the name of the VM.
       For example, `virtctl unpause vm myvm`.
    5. Verify the status:
       After unpausing the VM, use the `oc get vm` command to check its status.
       It should change to `Running`.

    Here's an example to unpause a VM named `myvm`:

    oc project myproject
