seed_examples:
   - question: How do I tie a square knot?
     answer: |
       Used for joining two ends of a single line to bind around an object. Not
       recommended for joining two ropes together as it can slip under tension.
       Lay the ends of two ropes parallel to each other. Take the right end over
       and under the left end. Repeat by taking the new right end over and under
       the new left end. Pull both ends to tighten the knot.
   - question: How do I tie a bowline knot?
     answer: |
       Creates a fixed loop at the end of a rope. Known for its strength and
       ease of untying, it's useful in rescue situations, sailing, and securing
       objects. Make a small loop (the rabbit hole) with enough rope for the
       desired loop size. Bring the end up through the hole, around the standing
       part, and back down. Pull on the end to tighten the knot.
   - question: How do I tie a figure-eight knot?
     answer: |
       A knot preventing the rope from running out of a retaining device.
       Commonly used in climbing for its strength and simplicity. Make a loop
       in the rope. Pass the end under the standing part and then back through
       the loop. Tighten by pulling the end while holding the standing part.
   - question: How do I tie a clove hitch knot?
     answer: |
       Used for attaching a rope to a post or tree securely. It's easily
       adjustable and quick to tie and untie. Pass the rope around the object.
       Cross the standing part by bringing the rope over again. Tuck the end
       under the last pass before tightening the knot.
