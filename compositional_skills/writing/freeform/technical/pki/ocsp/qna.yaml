task_description: >
  The OCSP validation task enables the answers to OCSP validation related
  questions in the case when OCSP Stapling is not enabled, specifically in the
  area of validation path and the number of OCSP requests encurred at each
  certificate validation. The Root CA's immediate subordinate CA is considered
  level 1 intermediate CA, whereas the subordinate CA of the level 1 subordinate
  CA is considered level 2 subordinate CA, etc.

  - question: >-
      In an environment where OCSP Stapling is not enabled, if certificate C is
      issued by a level 1 subordinate CA, what is the maximum number of OCSP
      responses that could potentially be received from the OCSP responder?
    answer: >
      If certificate C is issued by a level 1 subordinate CA, the maximum number
      of OCSP responses that could potentially be received from the OCSP
      responder is 3. This is because, a level 1 subordinate CA has 2 CA signing
      certificates in its chain, including the root CA, so when OCSP Stapling is
      not enabled, if OCSP is enabled, and all certs in chain contain an AIA
      extension, one OCSP request will be sent for the leaf certificate, and
      another 2 OCSP requests will be sent for the CAs in the chain. Therefore,
      there are 1+2=3 potential OCSP responses in total. It is worth noting that
      the root CA signing cert, being a self-signed cert, is a trust anchor and
      often time does not contain an AIA so in which case it would not trigger
      any OCSP responses. If OCSP caching is enabled, the number of OCSP
      responses received will be reduced, depending on whether the last OCSP
      response for certificate C, or the CAs in its chain are still in the cache
      or not.

      If certificate C is issued by a level 4 subordinate CA, the maximum number

    answer: >
      If certificate C is issued by a a root CA, the maximum number of OCSP
      responses that could potentially be received from the OCSP responder is 2.
      This is because, a root CA has 1 signing certificate in its chain, so when
      OCSP Stapling is not enabled, if OCSP is enabled, and all certs in chain
      contain an AIA extension, one OCSP request will be sent for the leaf
      certificate, and another 1 OCSP request will be sent for the CAs in the
      chain. Therefore, there are 1+1=2 potential OCSP responses in total. It is
      worth noting that the root CA signing cert, being a self-signed cert, is a
      trust anchor and often time does not contain an AIA so in which case it
      would not trigger any OCSP responses. If OCSP caching is enabled, the
      number of OCSP responses received will be reduced, depending on whether
      the last OCSP response for certificate C, or the CAs in its chain are
