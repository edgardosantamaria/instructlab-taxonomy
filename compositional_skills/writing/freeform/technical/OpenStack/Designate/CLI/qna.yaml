  - question: How do you create a zone using the OpenStack client?
    answer: |
      To create a zone using the OpenStack client, you can use the following
      command:
      ```bash
      openstack zone create --email <zone-email> <zone-name>
      ```
      Replace `<zone-email>` and `<zone-name>` with the actual values you want
      to use for your zone. Zone names must be a fully qualified domain name.

      For example, to create a zone for `example.com` with an administrative
      email address of `admin@example.com`, you would use the following
      command:
      ```bash
      oepnstack zone create --email admin@example.com example.com.
      ```
  - question: |
      How do you create a zone, with a specific Time To Live (TTL), using the
      OpenStack client?
    answer: |
      To create a zone that specifies a TTL using the OpenStack client, you can
      use the following command:
      ```bash
      openstack zone create --email <zone-email> --ttl <zone-ttl> <zone-name>
      ```
      Replace `<zone-email>`, `<zone-ttl>`, and `<zone-name>` with the actual
      values you want to use for your zone. The zone name must be a fully
      qualified domain name.

      For example, to create a zone for `example.com` with an administrative
      email address of `admin@example.com` and TTL of five minutes, you would
      use the following command:
      ```bash
      oepnstack zone create --email admin@example.com --ttl 300 example.com.
      ```
