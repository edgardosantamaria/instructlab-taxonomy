  - question: What it the Red Hat Security Data API Service?
    answer: |
      The Red Hat Security Data API exposes a list of endpoints to query
      security data with certain parameters and retrieve CSAF, CVE and
      OVAL data easily.
  - question: What data does the Red Hat Security Data API Service provide?
    answer: |
      The data provided by the Security Data API is the same as what is found
      on the Security Data page: OVAL definitions, Common Vulnerability
      Reporting Framework (CVRF) documents and CVE data. All data is available
      in its native XML format or in a representative JSON format.
  - question: What format does the Red Hat Security Data API Service output?
    answer: |
      The API supports JSON, XML, and HTML formats. The format can be
      specified as an extension to the url like .json or .xml.
  - question: What is the base URL for the Red Hat Security Data API Service ?
    answer: |
      The base URL is https://access.redhat.com/hydra/rest/securitydata
  - question: How can I look for a CVE in the the Red Hat
              Security Data API Service?
    answer: |
      You can use curl to get the results from a specific CVE. For example,
      if you would like information on CVE-2023-44487 you can run:
      $ export api_url = "https://access.redhat.com/hydra/rest/securitydata/cve"
      $ curl -s ${api_url}/CVE-2023-44487.json
  - question: How do I parse the JSON output to return certain fields?
    answer: |
      Once you're comfortable using curl, you can then pipe the output in to
      jq.  jq  can  transform JSON in various ways, by selecting, iterating,
      reducing and otherwise mangling JSON documents
      An example is to extract the Severity of a CVE:
      $ export api_url = "https://access.redhat.com/hydra/rest/securitydata/cve"
      $ curl -s ${api_url}/CVE-2023-44487.json
        | jq -r '.threat_severity'
        Important
  - question: How can I return the CVSS Score for a specific CVE?
    answer: |
      You can use jq to extract the CVSS score from a CVE
      $ export api_url = "https://access.redhat.com/hydra/rest/securitydata/cve"
      $ curl -s ${api_url}/CVE-2023-44487.json | jq -r '.cvss3.cvss3_base_score'
