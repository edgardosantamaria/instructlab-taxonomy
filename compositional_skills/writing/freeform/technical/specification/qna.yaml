      "Training your model on compositional skills and enhancing its abilities across various tasks, such as handling different document types, formatting information, and complex reasoning, is ambitious. Testing its limits can help you identify areas for improvement. Here are questions and tasks designed to challenge your model in the areas you mentioned. These are likely to be difficult for many models unless they have been specifically trained or fine-tuned to handle such nuanced requests:

      Adding New Types of Documents and Writing Styles:
          'Write a song lyric about the journey of a leaf falling from a tree, incorporating scientific terms.'
          'Compose a tweet summarizing the plot of 'War and Peace' in 280 characters.'

      Skills to Better Format and Reassemble Information:
          'Convert the following text into a bullet-point summary, each point no longer than 10 words.'
          'Create a compelling headline for an article about the benefits of deep-sea exploration.'

      Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
          'If Alice is taller than Bob, and Bob is taller than Charlie, but Dave is the tallest, who is the shortest?'
          'A train leaves from New York to Washington carrying 5 passengers. At Philadelphia, 2 get off and 4 get on. Who is the youngest passenger?'

      Table Analysis and Processing:
          'Given a table of countries and populations, identify the 3rd most populous.'
          'Join two tables: one with employees' names and departments, and another with departments and managers. List all employees under each manager.'

      Word Problems:
          'If a car travels at 60 miles per hour for 1.5 hours, how far does it go? Assume it stops for 15 minutes.'
          'Can a neural network model serve as a personal fitness trainer? Explain considering the model's limitations.'

      Searching, Extraction, and Summarization:
          'Summarize the main arguments of the last three Nobel Peace Prize lectures.'
          'Create a TODO list from the following project meeting transcript.'

      Complex Rulesets and Games:
          'Explain how to win at chess in 10 moves or less, assuming both players make optimal moves.'
          'Given the rules of a made-up card game where players draw and play cards to alter the game's 'reality,' explain how to achieve a specific 'reality' state.'

      Writing Style and Personalities:
          'Write an explanation of quantum computing for a 5-year-old.'
          'Adapt the story of Cinderella to reflect a cyberpunk future, using slang from the genre.'

      Instruction-Following Behavior:
          'Answer the following question in exactly 200 words: What are the implications of quantum supremacy for encryption technologies?'
          'Provide instructions for baking a cake, but format them as a diary entry.'"
  - question: "if A likes B and B likes c and C likes A, do you think A also like C"
    answer: |
      "If A likes B, B likes C, and C likes A, it suggests a mutual appreciation between A and C, at least from C's perspective. While this scenario creates a positive loop of liking each other, whether A likes C directly cannot be conclusively determined without understanding the reasons behind their likes. Personal preferences and affections can be influenced by various factors and are not automatically reciprocal just because of mutual connections. However, this setup does create a conducive environment for A to potentially like C, given the positive connections among them."
  - question: "how is the day today?"
    answer: |
      "I'm not able to provide real-time or location-specific weather updates or current day conditions. For the most accurate and up-to-date information on the weather or how the day is in your area, it's best to check a reliable weather service or app. Is there anything else you'd like to know or discuss that doesn't involve real-time data?"
  - question: "Which of the following statements comparing linear and logistic regressions is TRUE?"
    choices: 
      - "Both linear and logistic regression can be used to predict categorical responses and attain a point’s likelihood of belonging to each class."
      - "In this course, linear regression minimizes the mean absolute error, while logistic regression minimizes the mean squared error."
      - "Linear regression is used for a continuous target whereas logistic regression is more suitable for a categorical target."
      - "Independent variables in linear regression can be continuous or categorical, but can only be categorical in logistic regression."
    answer: |
      "Linear regression is used for a continuous target whereas logistic regression is more suitable for a categorical target.

      This statement accurately reflects the primary difference in the applications of linear and logistic regression. Linear regression is used for predicting outcomes that are continuous (e.g., house prices, temperatures), while logistic regression is used for binary (or categorical) outcomes (e.g., yes/no, win/lose)."
