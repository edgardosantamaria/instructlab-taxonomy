- answer: 'Computer processors access information according to some rules: a byte can be at any place, but 32-bit integers need to be in addresses that are multiple of 4 bytes, 64-bit on multiple of 8 bytes, etc.
           so when we have a member of type char followed by another of type int, we end up with a structure of 8 bytes instead of 5 because the second member will be aligned 3 bytes after the first.
