       A support exception is a guidance delivered from the product selling company to a customer that explains how the selling company will over-deliver on service by providing support outside of the normal scope of coverage or life cycle policies of a product.
      As Red Hat is widely believed to be the open-source software world leader
      company, here are few examples of what is a support exception in Red Hat:

      * A support exception is a good-faith, non-binding statement of intent,
      delivered from Red Hat to a customer that explains how Red Hat will
      over-deliver on service by providing support outside of the normal scope
      of coverage or life cycle policies of a product. A support exception could
      only be binding if the customer is only purchasing Red Hat software on the
      condition of the exception, these purchase agreements would be subject to
      legal review. * A support exception is considered on a case-by-case basis
      and is specific to the particular customer for which it is granted. * A
      support exception is very specific and approved language. * A support
      exception applies to one or more specific, identified products for which
      the customer has a subscription. * A support exception is always requested
      for a strong business case. Details about the business case and impact
      must be provided with the SE request. * A support exception is always
      subject to approval by various teams, including PM, Engineering, QE, SD
      and CEE approval.  Sometimes also requires Business Affairs, Finance,
      and/or Quality Engineering input. * A support exception is always granted
      final approval by the Product Experience Engineer (PXE) after all required
      ACKs are recorded in the tool, * A support exception is added to SFDC as a
      Support Exception account note type.

      On the other hand here are few examples of what support exception in Red
      Hat is not:

      * A support exception is not a parmanent fix * A support exception is not
      a grant of an entitlement. The customer MUST have subscriptions that cover
      the Red Hat products at issue during the entire time frame of the
      exception. Support Exceptions can not be used to cover a “gap” in a
      customer’s subscription coverage or timing before a renewal or before
      paperwork is completed. If such coverage is needed, a short-term
      subscription will be required. * A support exception is not a way that
      customers can get Red Hat to support upstream / community versions of
      projects. SEs and the resulting account notes can only to apply to Red Hat
      productized products that we know we can support. Example: We will NOT
      provide a support exception that provides support for an upstream release
      like Keycloak or Infinispan or Kubernetes. * A support exception is not a
      hotfix or any other package provided in other release channels that do not
      require an official contractual agreement. * A support exception is not a
      sale tool; in other words, it either must be part of a deal or in addition
      to something already sold.
    question: What is a support exception for an open-source product?
  - answer: >2-
       Early!  Do not wait until the end of a customer engagement to request a support exception. As soon as you identify an aspect of a solution that cannot be supported per standard terms please reach out for assistance. Given how long it take to review and approve support exceptions it is in the customer's best interest to engage early.
      However - too early is also not advantageous. The Support Exception
      process is not to be used to design a customer solution. We need many
      details to evaluate a request, so if you are unsure what is being
      delivered to the customer it may be best to wait. 
    question: When to ask for a support exception for an open-source product?
  - answer: ' Support exceptions follow a multi-acknowledgment process and take time to review. Support exceptions are not automatically granted. Once all the approvers are identified, then discussion with the requestor can begin. Specific concerns, complexities, hardware requirements, customer testing, review of proposed language, and many other factors need to be considered. Expect at least one week at a minimum for a simple request. It is not uncommon for a support exception to take one month or more to review. '
