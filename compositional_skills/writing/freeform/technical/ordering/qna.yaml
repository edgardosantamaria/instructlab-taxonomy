      1  1t (one ton)
      2. 1000kg (1000 kilograms, 1 ton)
      3. 100kg (one hundred kilograms) - Equivalent to 100 times 1kg (100kg = 100 x 1kg)
      4. 2kg (two kilograms)
      5. 1kg (one kilogram)
      6. 200g (two hundred grams) - Equivalent two tenths of a kilogram (200g = 0.2 x 1kg)
      7. 100g (one hundred grams) - Equivalent one tenth of a kilogram (100g = 0.1 x 1kg)
      8. 1g (one gram) - Equivalent one thousandth of a kilogram (1g = 0.001 x 1kg)

      1. 1t (one ton) - Equivalent to 1,000 kilograms
      2. 100kg (one hundred kilograms) - Equivalent to one hundred times 1kg (100kg = 100 x 1kg)
      3. 10g (ten grams) - Equivalent to ten times 1g (10g = 10 x 1g)
      4. 1g (one gram) - This is a smaller unit of weight, often used for small objects or when precise measurements 
      are required.

      2. 1t (one ton) - Equivalent to 1,000 kilograms (1t = 1,000kg)
      3. 1kg (one kilogram) - This is the standard unit for weighing objects in the metric system.
      4. 300g (three hundred grams) - Equivalent to three tenths of a kilogram (300g = 0.3 x 1kg)
      5. 200g (two hundred grams) - Equivalent to two tenths of a kilogram (200g = 0.2 x 1kg)
      6. 1g (one gram) - This is a smaller unit of weight, often used for small objects or when precise measurements 
      are required.
