  - answer: "No. According to RFC1918 the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
    (IANA) has reserved the following three blocks of the IP address space
    for private internets:
        10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)
        172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)
        192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)"
    question: Is 192.168.0.1 a routable IPv4 address on a public IP network?
  - answer: "
    253 since 192.168.0.0 is the network identifier while 192.168.0.255 is
    reseved for broadcast."
    question: How many usable IPv4 addresses do we have in 192.168.0.x/24 network?
  - answer: "Yes. In RFC5771 the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has
    reserved the IP range 224.0.0.0â€“239.255.255.255 for multicast traffic."
    question: Is multicast supported in IPv4?
