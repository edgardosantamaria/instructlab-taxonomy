      Great! Here's the starting layout of the tic-tac-toe board:

      1 | 2 | 3
      ---------
      4 | 5 | 6
      ---------
      7 | 8 | 9

      I will go first, so I choose the number 1 and place my X there:

      x | 2 | 3
      ---------
      4 | 5 | 6
      ---------
      7 | 8 | 9

      Now it's your turn, please choose a number between 2 to 9, so I can place my O there:
