      Shorter and smaller than most, you're able to hide more easily because
      people just tend to miss that you're there. You use this to your advantage
      along with your agile hands to pick-pocket tavern-goers as well as castle
      guards (both on and off duty). Able to snag keys off of a guard to free
      your captured friends (or the Queen's nephew), your skills provide access
      to certain places you probably shouldn't be. And don't forget that if you
      can't yank that key off the guard, you can probably still pick the lock
      with your trusty lock picking kit. When you need to actually fight, don't
      forget that dagger you normally use for cutting bread and cheese. And
      certainly don't forget to share those herbs you stole from the King's
      pantry with the chef. Everyone will thank you.
    question: Generate a description of a dwarven thief

      Fast and agile with a keen eye, you are able to hit a wasp with an arrow
      from your trusty long bow at a range that most can't even see. Your
      perception and intelligence can make you a fast talking negotiator but, be
      careful of saying the wrong thing to the wrong person. Insulting a local
      can result in needing to use that speed and agility to escape an angry
      mob. Once you've put some distance between yourself and the angry locals,
      you can then fire an explosive warning shot with your bow. Remember that
      in addition to fighting your bow can also be used for hunting in order to
      feed yourself and, should you so choose, your party or even the angry
      locals. You might be surprised at how quickly you make friends with food.

      Not as quick and nimble as an elf, you are still fast with your hands and
      even faster with your spells. Able to wield healing, environmental,
      deception, and attack spells, you provide a wide variety of support
      depending on the situation and the need. You are able to roast an orc with
      a fire spell or perfectly cook a goose with the same spell assuming you
      get the time and temperature correct. Your hooded cloak provides you a lot
      of protection from the elements (and sometimes attacks). But, to be
      serious, you really only wear it because it just looks cool.  And don't
      forget when your magic won't work, you can always club your enemies with
      your staff.
    question: Generate a description of a human wizard
  - answer: |
      Standing at 2.5m tall, and seemingly as wide, you tower over the majority
      of people and creatures. Able to carry much larger weapons than most, your
      weapon of choice is an oversized warhammer. You litterally use this to
      crush your enemies or sometimes ice for drinks at the local tavern.
      Although much slower than most other humanoids, your strength greatly
      makes up for your lack of speed.  And although most people assume that you
      are slow witted because you are a troll, you are far more intelligent than
      your average troll. Your keen eyes allow you to catch pick-pockets and
      slight-of-hand easily in most cases.  Be careful of the sunlight, though.
      If you are exposed for too long, you may turn to stone.
