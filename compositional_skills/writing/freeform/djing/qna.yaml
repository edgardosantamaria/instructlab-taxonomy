  - answer: 'Beat juggling is a DJing technique that has its origins in
      turntable mixing. In beat juggling, the DJ manipulates audio samples on
      physical turntables or jog wheels to create a new rhythmic pattern that is
      a unique combination of the original recordings. Often, there is a
      performance component to beat juggling. DJs may move around their
      performance space as they beat juggle, physically turn around and do some
      of the mixing behind their back, or move through a precise series of
      quickly orchestrated movements to create the rhythmic pattern they are
      performing. Beat juggling has its roots in the earliest forms of DJing,
      when in order to create the effect of a musical loop with vinyl records,
      DJs would use two identical records and play the "looping" section on one
      turntable while cutting the volume and spinnging the vinyl on the other
      turntable back to the begging of the section, and then cutting back to the
      original turntable when it is time to start the loop again.'

  - answer: 'A callback is a DJing technique where the DJ will replay part of a
      track that they performed earlier in their set. The callback is usually
      not a second straight playthrough, but instead may be a recognizable
      verse, or a remix of the song in a different tempo and style. Another way
      of using the callback is by opening with a well known song, mixing an
      extended departure in the middle of a track, and then coming back to that
      point in the first song and completing it before moving on to the next
      track in the set.'
