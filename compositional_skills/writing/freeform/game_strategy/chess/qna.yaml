      This position is from the Alekhine Defense, Larsen Variation. White has
      a hanging knight on f7, and black has no way to avoid the sacrifice.

      After 6. ... Kxf7, white has 7. Qh5+, forking black's king and d5 knight.
      Once black defends the knight with 7. ... Ke6, white can continue the attack
      with 8. c4. Although black's king is precariously placed in the center of the board,
      black does have a development advantage as white has only developed the queen.

      It can be surprisingly difficult for white to exploit their advantage,
      and the position scores roughly even in the lichess master database.

      Considering these factors, I evaluate the position to be +1.1, a reasonable advantage for white.

      However, it's important to note that the database results do not
      indicate that white has an easy time converting this position.

      This position is from the Queen's Gambit Declined, Exchange Variation.
      White has two main moves here:

      6. e3 and 6. Qc2. Although these moves frequently transpose to each other, 6. e3 is slightly more
      accurate because it prepares to develop the kingside with Bd3 and Nge2 / Nf3. 6. Qc2's main point
      is to stop Bf5, but this move is not threatening. For example: 6. e3, Bf5 7. Qf3 attacks the f5 bishop,
      and after 7. ... Bg6 white can transition to a favorable endgame with 8. Bxf6.

      So the best move is 6. e3

      Current moves: 1. e4 e6 2. d4

      2. ... d5. This pressures your e4 pawn, and you must defend it. Common ways for white to continue
      include:

      - 3. exd5, the Exchange Variation, relieving the tension in the center.

      - 3. e5, the Advance Variation. White gets a space advantage, but black gets counterplay against
      the d4 pawn.

      - 3. Nc3, the Paulsen Variation. Developing naturally in the center, this is possibly the most
      challenging move.

      Note that 3. Nc3 stops 3. ... c5 due to 4. exd5, exd5 5. dxc5, where white wins the d5 pawn.
      White also has 5. Bb5+, which may be even better.

      - 3. Nd2, the Tarrasch Variation. More modest than 3. Nc3, white retains the ability to play
      pawn c3, supporting the d4 pawn against black's eventual c5.

      Current moves: 1. e4

      Black to play

      I respond with 1. ... e6, the French Defense. This prepares 2. ... d5, striking white's e4 pawn and
      laying a claim to the center. While e6 does block my c8 bishop, it saves a few tempi compared
      to the Caro-Kann, where black must play c6 and then c5.
