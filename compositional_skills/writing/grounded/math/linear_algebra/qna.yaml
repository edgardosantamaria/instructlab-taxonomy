    To solve the system of linear equations using matrices, we first represent the system as a matrix equation:

    [ x ] = [ 1,  1 ] [ 4 ]
    [ y ]   [ 1, -1 ] [ 2 ]

    This can be written in the form Az = b, where

    A = [ 1,  1 ]
        [ 1, -1 ]

    b = [ 4 ]
        [ 2 ]

    z = [ x ]
        [ y ]

    Now, we can find the determinant of A:

    det(A) = (1)(-1) - (1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2

    Since det(A) ≠ 0, the system has a unique solution. To find the inverse of A, we can use the formula:

    A^(-1) = det(A)^(-1) * adj(A)

    where adj(A) is the adjugate matrix of A. In this case,

    A^(-1) = (-2)^(-1) * [ -1, -1 ] =
                         [ -1,  1 ]

           = -1/2 * [ -1, -1 ]
                    [ -1,  1 ]

           = [ 1/2,  1/2 ]
             [ 1/2, -1/2 ]

    Finally, we can find the solution z:

    z = A^(-1) * b
    z = [ x ] = [ 1/2,  1/2 ] [ 4 ] =
        [ y ]   [ 1/2, -1/2 ] [ 2 ]

      = [ (1/2)(4) +  (1/2)(2) ] =
        [ (1/2)(4) + (-1/2)(2) ]

      = [ 2 + 1 ] =
        [ 2 - 1 ]

      = [3]
        [1]

    So, the value of x is 3 and the value of y is 1.

    We can verify the solution by substituting x=3 and y=1 in the equations. Indeed,
    3+1=4 and 3-1=2.
  context: x+y=4 and x-y=2
  question: What are the values of x and y? Please solve using martices.

    To solve the system of linear equations using matrices, we first represent the system as a matrix equation:

    [ x ] = [ 1,  1 ] [ 2 ]
    [ y ]   [ 1, -1 ] [ 2 ]

    This can be written in the form Az = b, where

    A = [ 1,  1 ]
        [ 1, -1 ]

    b = [ 2 ]
        [ 2 ]

    z = [ x ]
        [ y ]

    Now, we can find the determinant of A:

    det(A) = (1)(-1) - (1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2

    Since det(A) ≠ 0, the system has a unique solution. To find the inverse of A, we can use the formula:

    A^(-1) = det(A)^(-1) * adj(A)

    where adj(A) is the adjugate matrix of A.

    For a general 2x2 matrix
       adj ( [ a, b ] )  = [  d, -b ]
             [ c, d ]      [ -c,  a ]

    So in this case,
       adj(A) = [ -1, -1 ]
                [ -1,  1 ]
    and

    A^(-1) = (-2)^(-1) * [ -1, -1 ] =
                         [ -1,  1 ]

           = -1/2 * [ -1, -1 ]
                    [ -1,  1 ]

           = [ 1/2,  1/2 ]
             [ 1/2, -1/2 ]

    Finally, we can find the solution z:

    z = A^(-1) * b
    z = [ x ] = [ 1/2,  1/2 ] [ 4 ] =
        [ y ]   [ 1/2, -1/2 ] [ 2 ]

      = [ (1/2)(2) +  (1/2)(2) ] =
        [ (1/2)(2) + (-1/2)(2) ]

      = [ 1 + 1 ] =
        [ 1 - 1 ]

      = [2]
        [0]

    So, the value of x is 2 and the value of y is 0.

    We can verify the solution by substituting x=2 and y=0 in the equations. Indeed,
    2+0=2 and 2-0=2.
  context: x+y=2 and x-y=2

    [ y ]   [ 2,  2 ] [ 4 ]

        [ 2,  2 ]

    b = [ 2 ]
        [ 4 ]

    z = [ x ]
        [ y ]

    Now, we can find the determinant of A:

    det(A) = (1)(2) - (1)(2) = 2 - 2 = 0

    Since det(A) ≠ 0, the inverse of A is not defied, and the system does not have a unique solution.
    We can only find y as a function of x: y=2-x .
