  - question: >
      If a word is translated from English to Morse Code, how would it look
      like? For example, the English word 'hello' is translated into '.... .
      .-.. .-.. ---'. What would the Morse Code for 'Hello' look like?
    answer: The Morse Code for 'Hello' is '.... . .-.. .-.. ---'.

      To translate a word 'hello' to Morse Code convert 'hello' to 'h-e-l-l-o'
      and tokenize and translate each letter into Morse Code separately. 'h' is
      '....', 'e' is '.', 'l' is '.-..', 'l' is '.-..', 'o' is '---'. What is
      the Morse Code translation for the word 'HELLO'?
    answer: Word 'HELLO' in Morse Code is '.... . .-.. .-.. ---'

  - question: >
      To translate a word 'sos' to Morse Code convert 'sos' to 's-o-s' and
      tokenize and translate each letter into Morse Code individually. 's' is
      '...', 'o' is '---', 's' is '...'. Imagine you have the text: 'SOS'.
      Create a translation of the text into Morse Code. Make sure that your
      Morse Code translation translates each letter of the word separately.
    answer: Word 'SOS' in Morse Code is '... --- ...'.
