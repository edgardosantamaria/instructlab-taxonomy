      Bionic Reading is a new method facilitating the reading process by guiding
      the eyes through text with artificial fixation points. As a result, the
      reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial letters and lets the
      brain center complete the word. In a digital world dominated by shallow
      forms of reading, Bionic Reading aims to encourage a more in-depth reading
      and understanding of written content.

      I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of
      Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which
      braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this
      feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I
      am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this
      wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain
      to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever
      presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight.
      There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting
      the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your
      leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow
      and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to
      a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto
      discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be
      without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are
      in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of
      eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the
      needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require
      only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for
      ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the
      world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by
      the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to
      conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this
      laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little
      boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native
      river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest
      the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last
      generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to
      reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining
      the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected
      by an undertaking such as mine.

      Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in
      the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she
      floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were
      compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that

      About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in
      every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no
      end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful
      with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our
      attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We perceived
      a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the
      north, at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a
      man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the
      dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes
      until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.

      This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,
      many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote
      that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in,

      About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before
      night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the
      morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which
      float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to
      rest for a few hours.

      In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and
      found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking
      to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen
      before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of
      ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it
      whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the
      other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered
      island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the master said, “Here is
      our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.”

      You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to
      me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have
      supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have
      exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied,
      however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.

      Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.
      Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his
      safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly
      frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I
      never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into
      the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted. We
      accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by
      rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As
      soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed
      him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered
      and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.

      Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often
      feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had
      in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on
      him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting
      creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even
      madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness
      towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole
      countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and
      sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and
      despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the
      weight of woes that oppresses him.
