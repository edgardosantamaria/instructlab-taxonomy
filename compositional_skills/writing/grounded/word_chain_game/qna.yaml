      Objective: The goal of Word Chain is to create a chain of words where each
      word starts with the last letter of the previous word. Starting Word: The
      game begins with one player choosing a word to start the chain. This word
      can be any word of their choosing. Continuing the Chain: The next player
      must respond with a word that starts with the last letter of the previous
      word. For example, if the previous word was 'apple' the next word could be
      'elephant' or 'egg.' Winning the game: Players must avoid repeating words
      that have already been used in the current game. If a player repeats a
      word, they lose the round. Length of Chain: The game can continue for as
      many rounds as players like, with each player taking turns contributing to
      the word chain. The longer the chain, the more challenging the game
      becomes. Constraints: The game can also be played with constraints like
      playing with only fruit names, places, or dishes to make it more
      interesting.
