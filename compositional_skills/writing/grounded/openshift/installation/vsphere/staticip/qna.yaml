  Generate an install-config.yaml with static IPs for install OpenShift on VMware
seed_examples:
  - question: |
      Can you describe and show me an example of an install-config.yaml for an OpenShift cluster
      on VMware with static IPs?
    context: |
      The cluster will be installed with platform vsphere with static IPs.
      The cluster will have an API and Ingress VIP. A host's IP, gateway
      and nameserver will not be the same address. Available roles are bootstrap,
      control-plane, and compute. The number of replicas is not provided to hosts.
    answer: |
      When installing with static IPs, each node to be created by the
      installer must be respresented in the hosts array. For a typical
      OpenShift cluster, 1 bootstrap node, 3 control plane nodes, and 3
      compute nodes would be defined in `hosts`.
