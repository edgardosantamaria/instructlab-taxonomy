      ROT13 (or rot13, Rot13 or ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher
      that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the Latin
      alphabet.

      Applying ROT13 to a text fragment requires examining its alphabetic
      characters and replacing each one by the letter 13 places further along in
      the alphabet, wrapping back to the beginning if necessary. A becomes N, B
      becomes O, and so on up to M, which becomes Z, then the sequence continues
      at the beginning of the alphabet: N becomes A, O becomes B, and so on to
      Z, which becomes M.

      Therefore, the letters are mapped as follows: A->N N->A B->O O->B C->P
      P->C D->Q Q->D E->R R->E F->S S->F G->T T->G H->U U->H I->V V->I J->W W->J
      K->X X->K L->Y Y->L M->Z Z->M

      Only those letters which occur in the English alphabet are affected;
      numbers, symbols, punctuation, whitespace, and all other characters are
      left unchanged.

      For example, the text "Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow." becomes
      "Fcuvak bs oynpx dhnegm, whqtr zl ibj." when ROT13 is applied.
