  The task enables the converstion of a given date into little
  or big endian date format.
seed_examples:
  - question: Convert the given date to the big-endian date format.
    answer: >
      To convert the given date, June 1st 2023, to the big-endian date format,

      we first need to identify the day, month, and year components of the given date.

      In this case, the day is 1st, the month is June, and the year is 2023.

      So, the 1st of June 2023 would be represented in the big-endian date format as:

      2023 June 1st.

      June 1st 2023
  - question: Convert the given date to the big-endian date format.
    answer: >
      To convert the given date, 16th December 1999, to the big-endian date
      format,

      we first need to identify the day, month, and year components of the given date.

      In this case, the day is 16th, the month is December, and the year is 1999.

      So, the 16th of December 1999 would be represented in the big-endian date format as:

      1999 December 16th.
    context: |
      16th December 1999
  - question: Convert the given date to the little-endian date format.
    answer: >
      To convert the given date, 2024 December 23rd, to the little-endian date
      format,

      we first need to identify the day, month, and year components of the given date.

      In this case, the day is 23rd, the month is December, and the year is 2024.

      So, the 23rd of December 2024 would be represented in the little-endian date format as:

      23rd December 2024.
    context: |
      2024 December 23rd

  - question: Convert the given date to the little-endian date format.
    answer: >
      The 26th of May 2021 would be represented in the little-endian date
      format as 26-05-2021.

    answer: >
      The 28-02-1876 would be represented in the big-endian date format as
      1876-02-28.
    context: |
      28-02-1876
  - question: Given the date, determine the date in the big-endian format.
    answer: >
      The December 31st, 2010 would be represented in the big-endian date
      format as 2010 December 31st.
    context: |
