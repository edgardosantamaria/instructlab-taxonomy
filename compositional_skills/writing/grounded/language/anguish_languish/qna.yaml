      Anguish Languish is an ersatz language constructed from similar-sounding
      English language words. It was created by Howard L. Chace circa 1940, and
      he later collected his stories and poems in the book Anguish Languish.  It
      is not really a language but rather humorous homophonic transformation.

      Chace offered this description: "The Anguish Languish consists only of the
      purest of English words, and its chief raison d'être is to demonstrate the
      marvelous versatility of a language in which almost anything can, if
      necessary, be made to mean something else." His story "Ladle Rat Rotten
      Hut" is "Little Red Riding Hood" re-written with similar-sounding words
      (all of them legitimate words in themselves, but with unrelated meanings)
      substituting for the original folk tale. A professor of French, Chace
      wrote "Ladle Rat Rotten Hut" in 1940 to demonstrate that the intonation of
      spoken English is almost as important to the meaning as the words
      themselves.
