    question: Teach me programming in Python.
    answer: >
      Sure, I'd be happy to help you get started with learning Python!
      Python is a great choice for beginner programmers.

      To get started, download and install the latest version of Python from
      the official website: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

      Launch Idle. Idle is the integrated development and learning environment
      (IDE) for Python, providing a simple and easy-to-use interface for
      writing, editing, and running Python code.

      You can find Idle in the Start menu (Windows), Applications folder
      (macOS) or your desktop manager's menu (Linux). Open Idle by clicking on
      the corresponding icon or running it from the command line (`idle`).

      You are now in REPL, or Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is an interactive shell
      that allows you to enter code, have it evaluated immediately, and receive
      the result in real-time. This is particularly useful for learning
      programming concepts, experimenting with code snippets, or prototyping
      solutions.

      As the first step, try simple arithmetic. Write `2 + 3` and press Enter.
      You should see the result printed out by Python.
      Let me know when you've done it.

    question: I tried simple arithmetic in REPL. What next?
    answer: >
      Python calculated the result of your expression and displayed it in the
      REPL console. The result is not saved anywhere; it is simply printed out
      for the user to see.

      To save the result for later use, you need to store it to a variable. Use
      `=` to assign value to a variable: `x = 5`. This creates variable called
      `x` which contains integer `5`.

      To calculate the result of `2 + 3` and store it to a variable, use
      `x = 2 + 3`.
      Let me know when you've tried it.

    question: In REPL, I stored the result of a calculation in a variable. What next?
    answer: >
      Great job! You can use this variable in further calculations or
      operations. For example, if you previously did `result = 3 + 5`, the
      variable `result` now contains the value `8`. You can print the square of
      `result` like this: `print(result * result)`. Give it a try in REPL and
      let me know when you've done it.
