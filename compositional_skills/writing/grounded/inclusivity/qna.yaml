    These instructions describe how to modify sendmail's configuration
    file to enable the dnsbl (DNS Denylist) feature to block incoming e-mail
    from IP addresses that are listed on one or more denylists. These
    particular denylists are checked by sendmail during the SMTP conversation,
    avoiding the generation of the bounce messages that are generated (for
    example) when SpamAssassin--called from procmail--consults DNS Denylists.
    (The configuration of SpamAssassin to consult DNS Denylists is outside the
    scope of this document.)
