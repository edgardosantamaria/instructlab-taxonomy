- context: >
    Passage 1:

    All employees in Plan ABC are eligible for Service XYZ; however, employees
    in HMOs, or who have opted out, are not eligible to use Service XYZ.

    Passage 2:

    All employees in Plan ABC are eligible for Service XYZ. This includes employees
    in HMOs, but excludes those who have opted out.
  question: >
    Does Passage 1 contradict Passage 2?
  answer: >
    Yes, Passage 1 contradicts Passage 2. In Passage 1, employees in HMOs are
    not eligible to use Service XYZ, while in Passage 2, employees in HMOs are
    eligible to use Service XYZ, which is a contradiction.

    Passage 1:

    The rotating screen of Product XYZ can set its orientation to Portrait or
    Landscape modes.

    Passage 2:

    Product XYZ is similar to ABC but, instead of having a rotating screen,
    XYZ can set its orientation to Portrait or Landscape modes.
  question: >
    Does Passage 1 contradict Passage 2?
  answer: >
    Yes, Passage 1 contradicts Passage 2. In Passage 1, Product XYZ has a
    rotating screen, while in Passage 2, the word "instead" implies that
    Product XYZ does not have a rotating screen, which is a contradiction.

    Passage 1:

    Model ABC is available either with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM,
    or with 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM.
    Model XYZ is available either with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM,
    or with 512GB of storage and 12GB of RAM.

    Passage 2:

    Models ABC and XYZ are available with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage.
  question: >
    Does Passage 1 contradict Passage 2?
  answer: >
    Yes, Passage 1 contradicts Passage 2. Passage 1 implies that Model XYZ
    is not available with 128GB of storage, while in Passage 2, Model XYZ
    is available with 128GB of storage, which is a contradiction.

- context: >
    Passage 1:

    Product XYZ offers some features that Product ABC does not. For example,
    XYZ has a touchscreen, while ABC has a keyboard instead.

    Passage 2:

    Product XYZ offers more features to its users than Product ABC. For example,
    only XYZ uses a touchscreen.
  question: >
    Does Passage 1 contradict Passage 2?
  answer: >
    Yes, Passage 1 contradicts Passage 2. In Passage 1, Product ABC has a feature
    that Product XYZ does not have, namely a keyboard; the word "instead"
    implies that Product XYZ does not have a keyboard. But in Passage 2, phrase
    "offers more features" implies that all features of Product ABC are also
    features of Product XYZ, hence Product XYZ must feature a keyboard too,
    which is a contradiction with Passage 1.

- context: >
    Passage 1:

    The product models compatible with Accessory ABC are: MX, MY, and MZ.
    The product models compatible with Accessory DEF are: MZ and MT.

    Passage 2:

    Our more advanced accessory ABC is compatible with more product models
    than our older accessory DEF.
  question: >
    Does Passage 1 contradict Passage 2?
  answer: >
    Yes, Passage 1 contradicts Passage 2. It follows from Passage 1 that
    Accessory ABC is not compatible with product model MT and Accessory DEF is
    compatible with MT. However, phrase "compatible with more product models"
    in Passage 2 implies that Accessory ABC is compatible with all product models
    compatible with DEF plus some more models. Since DEF is compatible with MT,
    Passage 2 implies that ABC is also compatible with MT, which is a
    contradiction with Passage 1.
