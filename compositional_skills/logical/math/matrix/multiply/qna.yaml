      Matrix multiplication requires that the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows
      in the second matrix. In this case, the first matrix is a row vector with dimensions 1x3, while the second
      matrix is a column vector with dimensions 3x1. Since the number of columns in the first matrix matches
      the number of rows in the second matrix, we can perform the multiplication.

      To multiply matrices [1, 2, 3] and [[1, 2, 3]], you can follow these steps:

      1. Multiply each element of the first row in the first matrix with each element of the first column
         in the second matrix.
      2. Add the results and store it as the first element of the first column.

      In the given example:

      1 * 1 = 1
      2 * 2 = 4
      3 * 3 = 9

      And we get: [14]

      Matrix multiplication requires that the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows
      in the second matrix.

      We will use the example of two compatible matrices:

      A = 1 2 3
          4 5 6

          1 2
      B = 3 4
          5 6

      We can give each element of each matrix the corresponding representation:

      A = A11 A12 A13
          A21 A22 A23

          B11 B12
      B = B21 B22
          B31 B32

      1. Determine the number of rows in the first matrix: This will be the number of rows in the resulting matrix.
      2. Determine the number of columns in the second matrix: This will be the number of columns
         in the resulting matrix.
      3. Initialize the resulting matrix: Create an empty matrix with the dimensions determined in steps 1 and 2.
      4. Multiply the matrices: For each element in the resulting matrix, multiply the corresponding elements
         in the first and second matrices and add them together.

      The number of rows in the first matrix is 2
      The number of columns in the second matrix is 2

      Our empty resulting matrix will be a 2 by 2 matrix:

      C = C11 C12
          C21 C22

      Based on what we know already, we calculate each element of our new resulting matrix:

      C11 = (A11 * B11) + (A12 * B21) + (A13 * B31)
      C12 = (A11 * B12) + (A12 * B22) + (A13 * B32)
      C21 = (A21 * B11) + (A22 * B21) + (A23 * B31)
      C22 = (A21 * B12) + (A22 * B22) + (A23 * B32)

      In the given example:

      C11 = (1 * 1) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 5) = 1 + 6 + 15 = 22
      C12 = (1 * 2) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 6) = 2 + 8 + 18 = 28
      C21 = (4 * 1) + (5 * 3) + (6 * 5) = 4 + 15 + 30 = 49
      C22 = (4 * 2) + (5 * 4) + (6 * 6) = 8 + 20 + 36 = 64

      Our resulting matrix C:

      C = 22 28
          49 64
