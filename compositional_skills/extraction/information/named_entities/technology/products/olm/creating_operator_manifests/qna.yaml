    A ClusterServiceVersion is a YAML manifest created from user-defined metadata that assists the Operator Lifecycle
    Manager (OLM) in running the operator in a cluster. It includes information about the operator's deployment, its
    dependencies and permissions, as well as the APIs it provides. It's a central part of the packaging metadata for
    OLM. 1
