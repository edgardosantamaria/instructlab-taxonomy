    The steps involved in creating a raw file-based catalog include initializing the Catalog, generating a Dockerfile,
    and populating the catalog with the operator. Afterwards, add a bundle to the catalog by rendering it into the
    catalog, then adding it to the desired channels. The final step is to validate the catalog to ensure there are no
    errors. 1
