    OperatorGroups in cluster operations allow cluster admins to control permissions. They are used to define the set
    of permissions and namespaces granted to member operators. An admin can create a single OperatorGroup in a
    namespace with the created ClusterServiceVersion in that namespace becoming a member operator of that
    OperatorGroup. The privileges of an operator are confined to that of the specified ServiceAccount in the
    OperatorGroup which defines the set of permissions for all member operators. This allows for self-sufficient
    installation of Operators by non-cluster-admin users with a limited scope. 1
