    The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and Catalog Operator are fundamental components when debugging in the context
    of a Kubernetes Operator. OLM manages the lifecycle of operators and their instances in a cluster, which aids in
    debugging by managing and tracking the changes and issues in various Operators. The Catalog Operator, on the other
    hand, is responsible for resolving and installing CSVs and CRDs in an Operator which can be essential in
    identifying and rectifying errors and bugs in the system. They work together to ensure smooth operation and ease
    troubleshooting process when an issue arises. 1
