    In Kubernetes, "priorityClassName: system-cluster-critical" refers to a class of pods that are critical to the
    operation of the entire cluster. These critical pods will not be evicted from the Node, even when the node is
    running out of resources under any circumstances. It ensures high priority tasks and processes in the cluster are
    always running. 1
