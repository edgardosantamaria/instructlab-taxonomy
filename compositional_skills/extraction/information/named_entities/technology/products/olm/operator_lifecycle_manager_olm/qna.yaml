    The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) is a component of the Operator Framework. It manages Kubernetes native
    applications, also called Operators, in a automated, effective, and scalable manner. OLM provides a declarative
    way to install, manage, and upgrade Operators and their dependencies within a cluster. 1
