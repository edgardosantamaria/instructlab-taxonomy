    An affinity definition can be removed from the operator deployment pod specification by using an empty object {}.
    This explicit removal can be effective for the original nodeAffinity while removing the original podAffinity and
    podAnitAffinity configurations. 1

    Removing Affinity Definitions: The use of an empty object {} can remove any affinity definition set in the
    operator deployment pod specification. Users can also keep the original nodeAffinity while removing the original
    podAffinity and podAnitAffinity configurations.
