    The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and Catalog operator log commands are used in the management and deployment
    of operators in a Kubernetes-based environment. These commands allow users to interact with and control the
    operators, allowing them to view, filter, and organize information about the operators. This aids in efficient and
    effective operator management. 1
