    The steps a Cluster Admin should take when uninstalling an operator from a cluster include: identifying the
    resources to remove, unsubscribing from the operator via the subscription resource, deleting the subscription
    associated with the operator to prevent new versions from being installed, and deleting the operator's
    ClusterServiceVersion (CSV). The Cluster Admin must also decide whether to delete the CustomResourceDefinitions
    (CRDs) and APIServices introduced to the cluster by the operator, and can safely remove the CRD or APIServices if
    no resources remain. 1

  Cluster Admin to remove or retain the CustomResourceDefinitions (CRD), APIServices, and resources related to these
  types owned by the operator - Protection against data loss through OLM not removing any of the operator's owned
  CRDs, APIServices, or CRs during uninstallation - Steps a Cluster Admin should take when uninstalling an operator
  - Identification of resources to remove - Unsubscribing from the Operator via the subscription resource -
  Possibility of reinstallations if the operator was installed with Automatic Updates - Need to delete the
  subscription associated with the operator to prevent new versions from being installed - Deletion of Operator's
  ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) - The CSV containing all information needed by OLM to manage an operator - Combination
  of steps for simultaneous deletion of Subscription and CSV - Decision on whether to delete the CRDs and
  APIServices introduced to the cluster by the operator - Safe removal of the CRD or APIServices if no resources
  remain
