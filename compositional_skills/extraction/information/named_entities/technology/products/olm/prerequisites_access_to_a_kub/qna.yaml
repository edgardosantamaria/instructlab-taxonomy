    The prerequisites to have access to a Kubernetes v depends on the specific version but generally you would need a
    compatible system, a package manager to install Kubernetes, and a basic understanding of its functions. You may
    also need cloud resources if you intend to use Kubernetes for cloud computing purposes. Standard prerequisites
    might also include a network that supports the necessary level of data traffic, and hardware that meets the
    minimum requirements for running the software. Specific prerequisites should be checked in the official Kubernetes
    documentation for each version. 1
