    The Upgradeable Condition prevents the existing CSV from being replaced by a newer version. It is set to False
    when an operator is about to start a critical process and should not be upgraded until the process is completed.
    Therefore, it prevents a channel entry in a scheduled package that replaces the operator's existing CSV from
    leaving the PendingPhase. 1
