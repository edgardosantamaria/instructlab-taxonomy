    In Declarative UI Controls, the Operators can behave similar to managed service providers. The Operator Lifecycle
    Manager (OLM) plays an essential part by annotating APIs with descriptors. These are useful for creating rich
    interfaces and forms that allow interaction with the Operator in a manner similar to a cloud platform. 1
