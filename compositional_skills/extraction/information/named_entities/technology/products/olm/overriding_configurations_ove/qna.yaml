    Overriding configurations will completely change the nodeAffinity configuration. If the affinity is removed, the
    original affinity configurations get canceled. 1

    Overriding Configurations: Overriding configurations will completely change the nodeAffinity configuration defined
    in the pod spec by the operator author. Similarly, in case of removing the affinity, the original affinity
    configurations get canceled.
