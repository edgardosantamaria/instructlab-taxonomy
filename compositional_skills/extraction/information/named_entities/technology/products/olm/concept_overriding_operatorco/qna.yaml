    Overriding OperatorConditions refers to the ability of Cluster Admins to ignore an "OLM Supported Condition"
    reported by an Operator by adding the condition's type and status to the spec.overrides array in the
    OperatorCondition Custom Resource. It is used to manage situations where an operator might be incorrectly
    reporting a state to OLM. 1
