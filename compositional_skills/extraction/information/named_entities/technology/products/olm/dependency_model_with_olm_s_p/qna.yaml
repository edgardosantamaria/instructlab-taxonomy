    The dependency model of OLM's packaging format allows Operators to express dependencies on the platform or other
    Operators. It ensures these requirements are met as long as the cluster is operating. 1
  context: |
    Dependency Model: With OLM's packaging format, Operators can express dependencies on the platform or other
    Operators. OLM ensures these requirements are respected for as long as the cluster is up.
