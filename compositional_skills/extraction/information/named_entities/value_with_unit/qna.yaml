      value, unit
      10, %
      1, AU
      150, g/cm^2
    context: In the absence of grains, x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150 g/cm^2).

    context: >
      The highest performance of the tandem cell has been confirmed by optimizing the electrical and optical properties of
      window, top absorber, CdSe (bandgap 1.7 eV), bottom absorber, CuSbSe2 (bandgap 1.08 eV) and back surface layers.

      100, PeV
    context: >
      In-ice radio-detection is a promising technique to discover and characterize ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos, with
      energies above 100 PeV, adopted by present - ARA, ARIANNA, and RNO-G - and planned - IceCube-Gen2.

    context: >
      The microstructure of the samples sintered in N2 was equiaxed with a grain size of 0.70 {\mu}m and a density of 98%
      of the theoretical value regardless of the sintering time.
