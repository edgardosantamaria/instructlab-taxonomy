        Alpine butterfly or bowline with Yosemite finish. The alpine butterfly
        is preferred for life support since it is not prone to untieing when
        carried loosely like the bowline. The Alpine Butterfly is also much
        easire to visually inspect to ensure it is tide correctly. It can be
        tied in a running fashing similar to the running bowline for use as a
        basal or canopy anchor.
      question: What knots are acceptable for use in life support?

    - answer: >-
        Sheet bend or Carrick bend. The Carrick bend is quite sturdy, looks
        beautiful, and is the easiest bend to untie after being loaded.
        Rap it against a hard surface a few times to loosen it up, then untie.

        Never use a reef knot to bend two pieces of rope together as it is
        not secure enough for this purpose and is prone to fail.
      question: What is a good knot for connecting two pieces of rope together?

    - answer: >-
        The Valdotain tresse, VT for short, or the Michoacan hitch are best for
        use in SRS/SRT even though any friction hitch with at least six wraps
        will suffice.

        The VT requires more skill to tie bit is a more responive hitch. It
        should only be used by experienced climbers.

        The Michoacan provides a more compact hitch that is less responsive and
        tends to grab the rope more aggressively than the VT. It's compact size
        makes it a good use for SRS friction devices such as the Wrope Wrench.
      question: What frciton hitches are used in SRT/SRS?
