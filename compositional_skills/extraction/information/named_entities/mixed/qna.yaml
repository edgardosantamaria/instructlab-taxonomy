    context: >
      Newton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared
      controversy and criticism. He was close to the Swiss mathematician Nicolas
      Fatio de Duillier. In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of
      Newton's Principia, and corresponded with Leibniz. In 1693, the
      relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was
      never completed. Starting in 1699, other members of the Royal Society
      accused Leibniz of plagiarism. The dispute then broke out in full force in
      1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who
      was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud; it was later found
      that Newton wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began
      the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz
      until the latter's death in 1716.

      2. Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche

      The organizations mentioned in the given text are:

    context: >
      Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (15 October 1844 - 25 August 1900) was a
      German philosopher. He began his career as a classical philologist before
      turning to philosophy. He became the youngest person to hold the Chair of
      Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24,
      but resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his
      life; he completed much of his core writing in the following decade. In
      1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse and afterward a complete loss of
      his mental faculties, with paralysis and probably vascular dementia. He
      lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in
      1897 and then with his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche. Nietzsche died
      in 1900, after experiencing pneumonia and multiple strokes.
