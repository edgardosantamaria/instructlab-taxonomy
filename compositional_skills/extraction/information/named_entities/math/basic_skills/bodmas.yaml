  - question: What is BODMAS
    answer: |
      BODMAS is an acronym that represents the order of operations used in
      mathematics to solve mathematical expressions. It stands for:

      1. B - Brackets: Solve expressions inside brackets (parentheses) first.
      2. O - Orders (Exponents): Evaluate expressions with exponents or powers.
      3. D - Division: Perform division from left to right.
      4. M - Multiplication: Perform multiplication from left to right.
      5. A - Addition: Perform addition from left to right.
      6. S - Subtraction: Perform subtraction from left to right.

      The purpose of BODMAS is to establish a standardized way of solving mathematical
      expressions, ensuring that everyone follows the same order of operations to arrive
      at a consistent and correct result. Adhering to the BODMAS rule prevents ambiguity
      and ensures that mathematical expressions are evaluated accurately.

  - question: Solve 3+5*2-4
    answer: |
      Apply BODMAS:
      3 + (5*2) - 4
      3 + 10 - 4
      13 - 4
      9

  - question: Solve 2+3*(4-1)
    answer: |
      Apply BODMAS
      2 + 3 * (4-1)
      2 + 3 * 3
      2 + 9
      11

  - question: Solve 5*(2^2+3)/4
    answer: |
      Apply BODMAS
      5 * (4 + 3) / 4
      5 * 7 / 4
      35 / 4
      8.75

  - question: can you solve 6^2-(5*2)-((1+1)-(4+3))
    answer: |
      Apply BODMAS
      6^2-(5*2)-((1+1)-(4+3))
      36 - 10 - (2 - 7)
      36 - 10 - (-5)
      36 - 10 + 5
      26 + 5
      41
