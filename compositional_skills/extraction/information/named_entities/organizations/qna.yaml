      On December 14, 2017 The Walt Disney Company announced its intent 
      to acquire the motion picture, cable entertainment, and direct broadcast satellite 
      divisions of 21st Century Fox, including 20th Century Fox, for $52.4 billion. The 
      remainder of the company would form a so-called "New Fox", maintaining control of 
      assets such as Fox's television network and broadcast stations (which Disney, already 
      owning ABC, would be legally unable to own due to an FCC policy known as the "dual 
      network rule", which prohibits mergers between the top broadcast networks), Fox News, 
      the national operations of Fox Sports, and the 20th Century Fox studio lot, which would 
      be leased to Disney for seven years. Fox's regional sports networks were also included 
      in the sale, but were later divested by order of the Department of Justice, on the
      grounds that the Fox regional networks' combination with Disney's 80% ownership of 
      ESPN would make Disney too dominant in the cable sports market.\n\nIn May 2018 it 
      was confirmed that Lachlan Murdoch, rather than James Murdoch, would take charge of 
      the New Fox company.\n\nIn mid-2018 NBCUniversal's parent company Comcast instigated 
      bidding wars over both the Fox assets Disney planned to purchase, and the British 
      broadcaster Sky plc (a company which 21st Century Fox held a stake in, and was planning 
      to acquire the remainder). In July 2018, Fox agreed to an increase of Disney's offer 
      to $71.3 billion to fend off Comcast's counter-bid. British regulators ordered that 
      a blind auction be held for Sky's assets, which was won by Comcast.

      On October 10, 2018, it was reported that in preparation for the impending
      completion of the sale, the new, post-merger organizational structure of "New Fox"
      would be implemented by January 1, 2019. On November 14, 2018, it was revealed that
      the new independent company will maintain the original Fox name. On January 7, 2019,
      Fox Corporation's registration statement was filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
      Commission.\n\nOn January 11, 2019, Fox stated in a securities filing that it had no 
      plans to bid on its former regional sports networks; they would instead go to a consortium 
      led by Sinclair Broadcast Group, with Fox Corporation continuing to license the FSN name 
      to those stations until Sinclair developed a new brand (the networks would eventually 
      become Bally Sports). On March 12, 2019, Disney announced that the sale would be completed 
      by March 20, 2019. On March 19, 2019, Fox Corporation officially began trading on the S&P 
      500, replacing 21st Century Fox on the index. Republican politician and former Speaker 
      of the House Paul Ryan also joined Fox Corporation's board at this time.
