  context: The Washington Huskies are the intercollegiate athletic teams that
    represent the University of Washington, located in Seattle. The school
    competes at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I
    level as a member of the Pac-12 Conference.

    Washington students, sports teams, and alumni are called Huskies. The husky
    was selected as the school mascot by the Associated Students of UW in 1922.
    It replaced the "Sun Dodger", an abstract reference to the local weather
    that was quickly dropped in favor of something more tangible. The costumed
    "Harry the Husky" performs at sporting and special events, and a live
    Alaskan Malamute, currently named Dubs, traditionally leads the football
    team onto the field at the start of games. The school colors of purple and
    gold were adopted in 1892 by student vote.

  context: The Oregon Ducks are the intercollegiate athletic teams that
    represent the University of Oregon, located in Eugene. The Ducks compete
    at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level as
    a member of the Big Ten. With eighteen varsity teams, Oregon is best known
    for its American football team and track and field program, which has
    helped Eugene gain a reputation as "Track Town, USA". Oregon's main
    rivalries are with the Oregon State Beavers (the Civil War) and the
    Washington Huskies.

    Oregon teams were originally known as Webfoots, possibly as early as the
    1890s. The Webfoots name originally applied to a group of fishermen from
    the coast of Massachusetts who had been heroes during the American
    Revolutionary War; their descendants had settled in Oregon's Willamette
    Valley in the 19th century and the name stayed with them. A naming
    contest in 1926 won by Oregonian sports editor L. H. Gregory made the
    Webfoots name official, and a subsequent student vote in 1932 affirmed
    the nickname, chosen over other suggested nicknames such as Pioneers,
    Trappers, Lumberjacks, Wolves, and Yellow Jackets.

    Ducks, with their webbed feet, began to be associated with the team in
    the 1920s, and live duck mascots were adopted to represent the team.
    Journalists, especially headline writers, also adopted the shorter Duck
    nickname, but it was not until the 1940s that the image of Donald Duck,
    permitted via a handshake deal between Walt Disney and Oregon athletic
    director Leo Harris, cemented the image of the Duck as the school's
    mascot. Both nicknames were still in use well into the 1970s.

    In 1978, a student cartoonist came up with a new duck image, but students
    rejected the alternative by a 2-to-1 margin. Although Donald was not on
    that ballot, the University Archivist declared that the election made
    Ducks the school's official mascot, replacing Webfoots.

    The school colors are green and yellow.

  context: The UCLA Bruins are the athletic teams that represent the
    University of California, Los Angeles. The Bruin men's and women's teams
    participate in NCAA Division I as part of the Pac-12 Conference and the
    Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF). For football, they are in the
    Football Bowl Subdivision of Division I (formerly Division I-A). UCLA is
    second to only Stanford University as the school with the most NCAA team
    championships at 121 NCAA team championships. UCLA offers 11 varsity
    sports programs for men and 14 for women.

    UCLA is scheduled to join the Big Ten Conference with their crosstown
    rival, USC, in 2024.

    The UCLA athletic teams' colors are UCLA Blue and Westwood Gold. Blue
    symbolizes the ocean and wildflowers; yellow to reflect the Golden State,
    the California poppy and sunsets.
