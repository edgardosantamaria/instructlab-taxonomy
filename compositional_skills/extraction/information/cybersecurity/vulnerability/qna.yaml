  - question: What's the vulnerability type in this issue description?
    answer: |
      Arbitrary code execution
    context: |
      A flaw was found in expat. Passing malformed 2- and 3-byte UTF-8 sequences (for example, from start tag names)
      to the XML processing application on top of expat can lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue is dependent
      on how invalid UTF-8 is handled inside the XML processor.

    answer: |
      Predictable random number generator
    context: |
      OpenSSL 0.9.8c-1 up to versions before 0.9.8g-9 on Debian-based operating systems uses a random number generator
      that generates predictable numbers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute force guessing
      attacks against cryptographic keys.

    answer: |
      Heap-based buffer overflow
    context: |
      A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libvpx, a library used to process VP8 and VP9 video codecs
      data, processes certain specially formatted video data via a crafted HTML page. This flaw allows an attacker to
      crash or remotely execute arbitrary code in an application, such as a web browser that is compiled with this
      library.
  - question: What's the vulnerability type in this issue description?
    answer: |
      Insufficiently trustworthy search path
    context: |
      A vulnerability was found in OpenSSH. The PKCS#11 feature in the ssh-agent in OpenSSH has an insufficiently
      trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled
      system (the code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent). This flaw allows an attacker
      with control of the forwarded agent-socket on the server and the ability to write to the filesystem of the client
      host to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ssh-agent.
