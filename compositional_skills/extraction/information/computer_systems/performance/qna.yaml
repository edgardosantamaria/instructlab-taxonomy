      The `pmlogger(1)` command is used to record metrics in PCP.
      It is typically enabled using
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl enable --now pmlogger
      ```
      Recording is also automatically enabled when pcp-zeroconf is installed.
      Some PCP tools provide an option for recording the metrics they are
      currently configured to use.  These include `pmrep(1)` and `pmchart(1)`.

      How can I record performance data with Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)?

  - answer: |
      The `pmlogger(1)` command is used to record metrics in PCP, and it is
      configured using either the `pmlogconf(1)` command, or through direct
      editing of configuration files.
    question: |
      How to configure which metrics are recorded by Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)?

  - answer: |
      The `pmlogger(1)` command is used to record metrics in PCP, and it has
      a default behaviour of sampling once every 60 seconds.
      This can be configured in a number of ways:
      1. Installation of the pcp-zeroconf package changes the default sampling
         interval to 10 seconds.
      2. The -t/--interval command line option changes the sampling interval.
      3. The pmlogger environment variable PMLOGGER_INTERVAL can be used.
         When run as a service the /etc/sysconfig/pmlogger can be modified
         to change this value.
      4. Each performance metric group in the pmlogger configuration file can
         have a logging interval configured specifically for that group.
