      The strace(1) command can be used to trace what processes are spawned.
      The commandline is
      ```bash
      strace -f -e trace=clone,fork,execve
      ```
    question: |
      How can I strace a process to see what processes it spawns?
  - answer: |
      The strace(1) command can trace all linux system calls that it knows
      about. Useful syscalls to select are:
      ```
      open,openat,stat,execve
      ```
    question: |
      What syscalls can strace trace?
  - answer: |
      The output of strace(1) can be overwhelming. It is useful to limit
      the amount of the syscalls traced. Syscalls like poll,select,futex
      will otherwise spam the output too much. It is also possible to
      exclude syscalls via the `!` operator (be careful about shell quoting).
      Example:
      ```bash
      strace -e trace='!select,poll,ppoll' some-command
      ```
      Another option is to log the output into a file. This can be done
      via the `-o file` option. E.g.
      ```bash
      strace -o my-strace.log some-command
      ````
    question: |
      There is too much output of strace, what can I do?
