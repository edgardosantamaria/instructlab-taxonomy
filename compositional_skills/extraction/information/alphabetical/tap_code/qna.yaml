  question: What does '. ..  . .  . ..  ..... ....'  translate from tap code?

- answer: The tap code, sometimes called the knock code, is a way to encode text messages
      on a letter-by-letter basis in a very simple way. The message is transmitted using a
      series of tap sounds, hence its name. The tap code has been commonly used by prisoners
      to communicate with each other. The method of communicating is usually by tapping either
      the metal bars, pipes or the walls inside a cell.
  question: What is tap code or knock code?
- answer: The tap code is based on a Polybius square using a 5Ã—5 grid of letters
      representing all the letters of the Latin alphabet, except for K, which is represented
      by C. Each letter is communicated by tapping two numbers, the first designating the row
      and the second (after a pause) designating the column. For example, to specify the
      letter "B", one taps once, pauses, and then taps twice. The listener only needs to
      discriminate the timing of the taps to isolate letters. In communication of a whole word
      pause between each number in a pair is shorter than the pause between letters.
      The letter "X" is used to break up sentences.
  question: What is the design for the tap code or how does it work?
- answer: Letter "X" can be used to break up sentences in tap code.
  question: How to break up sentences in tap code or knock code?
- answer: The origins of this encoding go back to the Polybius square of Ancient Greece.
      Like the "knock code", a Cyrillic script version is said to have been used by
      nihilist prisoners of the Russian czars. United States prisoners of war during the
      Vietnam War are most known for having used the tap code. In 1980, a doctor sentenced
      to life in solitary confinement in Somalia used tap code to share the entirety of
      Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, nearly 2 million letters, via tap code with fellow prisoners.
