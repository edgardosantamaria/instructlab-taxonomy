  - question: |
      Bob has two dogs. Each dog lives with three cats. How many cats does
      Bob live with?
    answer: |
      Bob lives with 3 cats. If each of Bob's two dogs lives with three cats,
      and these cats are shared among the dogs rather than being unique to each
      dog, then Bob lives with 3 cats in total.

  - question: |
      Alice and Bob live together. Alice lives with 2 dogs. Bob lives with two
      dogs. How many dogs are in the house?
    answer: |
      There are two dogs in the house. If Alice and Bob live together, and Alice
      lives with 2 dogs while Bob also lives with 2 dogs, but they are sharing
      the same living space, it means they collectively have 2 dogs in the
      house, not 4, since the description implies they are counting the same
      dogs.

  - question: |
      Andrew and Ben work in the same office building. Andrew's office building
      has two conference rooms. Ben's office building has two conference rooms.
      What is the total number of conference rooms in the building?
    answer: |
      There are two conference rooms in the office building. If Andrew and
      Ben work in the same office building, and the information about the number
      of conference rooms is given for both Andrew's and Ben's office building,
      we're actually talking about the same building. Therefore, the total
      number of conference rooms in the building is two.

      There are a total of two stop signs on the street. If Andrew and Bob live
      on the same street, and both statements refer to this street having two
      stop signs, then there are a total of two stop signs on the street.
