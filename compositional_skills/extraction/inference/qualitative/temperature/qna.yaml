    There are 3 light bulbs in the room, and none of them is shining. One of
    the bulbs was just switched off after it was turned on for an hour.
  question: |
    How do I know which bulb was turned on recently?
  answer: |
    I can carefully put my finger on all bulbs and sense the temperature.
    Since the bulb gets hot when turned on and the temperature decreases
    slowly, the bulb which was turned on recently will have the highest
    temperature.

    There are 10 cars in the garage. One of them just parked a minute ago
    after driving for 2 hours.
  question: |
    How can I tell which car it was?
  answer: |
    When a car goes on a street, several parts change temperature and get warm.
    The engine of the car gets warm because there are small explosions inside.
    Other parts get warm because of friction between parts or between wheels
    and the tarmac.
    So, one way to tell which car was driving recently is to open the hood
    and carefully touch the engine. If the engine is warm then it is the car
    that was driving recently.
    Another way is to carefully touch the tires. When a car is going fast,
    the tires get warm, so the car that has warm tires is most likely the one
    that was driving recently.

    There are 8 chairs in a meeting room. 3 people just finished a meeting
    that took an hour.
  question: |
    How can I tell where the people were sitting?
  answer: |
    When a person sits on a chair, the chair gets warmer. So, one way to tell
    which chair was occupied recently is to touch the chair and feel
    the temperature.
    The three chairs that are the warmest are likely those where the three
    people were sitting.

    There are several toilets in the lavatory in the office. One colleague just
    left the lavatory.
  question: |
    How can I tell which toilet the person just used?
  answer: |
    When a person sits on a toilet, the toilet gets a bit warmer from the
    human's body. Thus, one way to tell which toilet was occupied a minute ago
    is to carefully touch the toilet seat and consider the temperature.
    The warmest toilet seat is the one that the person most likely was
    sitting on.

    There are 10 beers on a table. Some are on the table for several hours
    already. Some were just brought to the table by a waiter.
  question: |
    How can one tell which beer is fresh?
  answer: |
    When a beer is served, it is mostly cold. When a beer says on a table
    for an hour, the beer gets warmer because of the warm air around.
    When a person wants to pick the beer that is fresh, the person can
    touch the glass of the table and the beers which the lowest temperature
    is most likely the fresh one.
