      Children can be traumatized by violence, frank depictions of adult
      sexuality, disturbing or frightening images, and coarse or profane
      language. Children are vulnerable to learning the wrong message when
      presented with explicit depictions of immoral behavior.
      This movie is appropriate for all ages. It has positive messages that make
      the viewer feel good. There are scenes of intense excitement, and there
      are scenes where the villain taunts the heros and there is a fight scene.
      There is a romantic connection between the two main characters, and in one
      final scene they kiss romantically. All of the characters freinds and
      family come together and celebrate happily. It should be safe watching for
      families and children of any age.
    question: Will my children be harmed by watching this movie?

      The story centers on Ariel, a young mermaid princess who is fascinated by
      the human world. Despite the warnings of her father, King Triton, Ariel
      frequently visits the surface to collect human artifacts and dreams of
      living among humans. One day, Ariel saves Prince Eric, a human, from
      drowning during a storm and falls deeply in love with him. Desperate to be
      with him but unable to do so in her mermaid form, Ariel makes a deal with
      Ursula, the sea witch. In exchange for her voice, Ursula transforms Ariel
      into a human for three days. However, there's a catch, Ariel must receive
      "true love's kiss" from Eric before the sunset on the third day, or she
      will turn back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. Ariel arrives on land
      and quickly befriends Eric, but without her voice, she struggles to
      communicate her identity and feelings to him. As the deadline approaches,
      Ursula, seeing that her plan to keep Ariel away from Eric might fail,
      takes matters into her own hands. She disguises herself and uses Ariel's
      voice to enchant Eric, planning to marry him to thwart Ariel's chances.
      Ariel and her friends uncover Ursula's plot and intervene, leading to a
      climactic battle. King Triton offers himself in Ariel's place to save his
      daughter, becoming a prisoner of Ursula. Ariel and Eric then work together
      to defeat Ursula, restoring peace to the sea. Moved by Ariel's love for
      Eric and her desire to live in the human world, Triton grants her the gift
      of becoming human permanently. Ariel and Eric marry, uniting the land and
      sea kingdoms, and live happily ever after. The story of "The Little
      Mermaid" is a tale of love, sacrifice, and the pursuit of one's dreams,
      teaching lessons about the importance of understanding and compassion
      across different worlds.

      "Babylon," directed by Damien Chazelle and released in 2022, is a
      sprawling epic that delves into the excess, decadence, and transformation
      of Hollywood during its transition from silent films to talkies in the
      late 1920s and early 1930s. The film combines historical fiction with a
      vivid portrayal of the era's changing social and cultural landscape,
      exploring the rise and fall of multiple characters navigating the seismic
      shifts within the film industry. The narrative follows several key
      figures. Manny Torres, an ambitious immigrant with dreams of making it big
      in Hollywood; Nellie LaRoy, a wild and talented actress who embodies the
      era's reckless abandon and hunger for fame; and Jack Conrad, a fading
      silent film star struggling to adapt to the advent of sound in cinema.
      These characters, along with a diverse ensemble cast, represent the
      diverse facets of Hollywood's ecosystem, from the glitz and glamour to the
      dark underbelly of the industry. "Babylon" is characterized by its opulent
      set pieces, extravagant parties, and unflinching look at the hedonism and
      moral complexities of the time. The film addresses themes of ambition,
      identity, artistry, and the impermanence of fame, showcasing the personal
      triumphs and tragedies of those who are caught up in the relentless
      pursuit of success. During many long orgies, the camera zooms in on
      different couples engaged in graphic sex acts, including anal, that
      display explicit full nudity & a champagne bottle shoved into a rectum.
      Erotic dancing at orgy/parties is seen extensively throughout the movie
      with severely sexualized female imagery & nudity, especially bare breasts,
      inclusive of many full frontals. Sexually explicit dialogue, innuendo &
      acts are frequent. The opening thirty minutes of the film are filled to
      the brim with graphic sex and nudity. Countless naked women are
      graphically shown in full view, with tons of bare breasts and full
      frontal, hairy genitals. There is tons more graphic sex and full frontal
      nudity throughout the film. We see Jack's bare butt thrusting as he and
      Jen the waitress have sex standing up at one of the parties.

      Nudity is usually limited to shirtless guys or the naked backs of women.
      Around 1 or 2 sex scenes per season, never that explicit. The most
      explicit contain thrusting and implied orgasms. This series is very
      violent. Every episode the main characters are killing monsters, blood
      and gore shown from episode to episode varies depending on the type of
      monster the main characters are hunting. The profanities used are mostly
      mild, but they are used very frequently. Fairly common uses of "ass",
      "bitch", "damn", "hell", "dick" and "crap" as well as some miscellaneous
      other mild profanities. Several characters are alcohol dependent, some
      scenes take place in bars where people are shown drinking or smoking.
      Lots of scary and intense scenes on this show, to the point where it
      can be very emotional and violent. Rated TV-14 in Canada and in the US
      some episodes are rated TV-14 and a few episodes are rated TV-MA.
