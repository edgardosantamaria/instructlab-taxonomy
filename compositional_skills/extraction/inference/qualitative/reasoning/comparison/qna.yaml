  - question: |
      A scientist runs an experiment testing the relative speeds of 4 mice.
      Mouse 1 beats mouse 2 in the first race. In the second race, mouse 2 runs
      faster than mouse 3. In the third race, mouse 4 runs faster than mouse 3.
      Assuming each mouse runs at the same speed as they did in these races,
      would mouse 1 beat mouse 2?
    answer: |
      Yes, mouse 1 would beat mouse 2 in a race because mouse 1 is faster than
      mouse 2. We know this since the given information tells us that mouse 1
      already beat mouse 2 in a race, and we are to assume that that the mice
      will run at the same speeds as they did in the previous races.
  - question: |
      A scientist runs an experiment testing the relative speeds of 4 mice.
      Mouse 1 beats mouse 2 in the first race. In the second race, mouse 2 runs
      faster than mouse 3. In the third race, mouse 4 runs faster than mouse 3.
      Assuming each mouse runs at the same speed as they did in these races,
      would mouse 4 beat mouse 1?
    answer: |
      We cannot conclude whether mouse 4 would beat mouse 1 in a race. Based on
      the given information, we know that mouse 1 is faster than both mice 2 and
      3. We also know that mouse 4 is faster than mouse 3. However, since we do
      not know the actual speeds of any of the mice and have to rely on only the
      3 comparison races, we do not have adequate information to compare mouse 4
      to either mouse 1 or 2. Mouse 4 could be the fastest of them all, it could
      be faster than mouse 2 but slower than mouse 1, or it could be slower than
      both mouse 1 and mouse 2. All are equally possible with the given
      information. All we can conclude about mouse 4 is that it is faster than
      mouse 3.

      A scientist runs an experiment testing the relative speeds of 4 mice.
      Mouse 1 beats mouse 2 in the first race. In the second race, mouse 2 runs
      faster than mouse 3. In the third race, mouse 4 runs faster than mouse 3.
      Assuming each mouse runs at the same speed as they did in these races,
      would mouse 3 beat mouse 1?
    answer: |
      No, mouse 3 would not beat mouse 1 in a race since mouse 3 is slower than
      mouse 1. We know from the results of the three races that Mouse 1 is
      faster than mouse 2 and mouse 2 is faster than mouse 3. Therefore, mouse 1
      is also faster than mouse 3 which means mouse 3 would lose to mouse 1 in a
      race.

      Consider 3 companies named Banana Incorporated, Banana International, and
      Bananas for Bananas. If Banana Incorporated has more bananas in its
      stockpile than Bananas for Bananas, and Banana International has fewer
      bananas in its stockpile than Banana Incorporated, does Bananas for
      Bananas have more bananas than Banana International?
    answer: |
      Based on the information provided, we do not know how the stockpiles of
      Bananas for Bananas and Bananas International compare. All we know is that
      both of these companies have fewer bananas than Bananas Incorporated. In
      this scenario, either company could have more bananas than the other.

  - question: |
      Consider 3 companies named Banana Incorporated, Banana International, and
      Bananas for Bananas. If Banana Incorporated has more bananas in its
      stockpile than Bananas for Bananas, and Banana International has fewer
      bananas in its stockpile than Banana Incorporated, which company has the
      most bananas?
    answer: |
      We can conclude that Bananas Incorporated has the most bananas. The
      provided information tells us that Bananas Incorporated has more bananas
      than both Bananas for Bananas and Bananas International. While we cannot
      directly compare the number of bananas in the stockpiles of Bananas for
      Bananas and Bananas International, we do know for certain that both have
      fewer bananas than Bananas Incorporated.
  - question: |
      Ada is taller than Markus. Markus is taller than Evelyn. Is Evelyn taller
      than Ada?
    answer: |
      No, Evelyn is not taller than Ada. Since we know the relative heights of
      Ada, Markus, and Evelyn, we can conclude that Ada is the tallest, since
      she is taller than Markus, and Evelyn is the shortest, since she is
      shorter than Markus. Put another way, Evelyn cannot possibly be taller
      than Ada since we know that Ada is taller than Markus and Markus is taller
      than Evelyn.
  - question: |
      Ada is taller than Markus. Markus is taller than Evelyn. Is Ada taller
      than Evelyn?
    answer: |
      Yes, Ada is taller than Evelyn. Since we know the relative heights of Ada,
      Markus, and Evelyn, we can conclude that Ada is the tallest, since she is
      taller than Markus, and Evenlyn is the shortest, since she is shorter than
      Markus. Put another way, Evelyn cannot possibly be taller than Ada since
      we know that Ada is taller than Markus and Markus is taller than Evelyn.
