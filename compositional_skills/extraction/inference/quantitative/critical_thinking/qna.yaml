- answer: 'If we assume that each shirt dries independently of the others
    and that the drying process is not affected by the presence of other
    shirts, then the time it takes for all five shirts to dry would be
    approximately the same as it takes for one shirt to dry. \nSo, if it
    takes 2 hours for one shirt to dry, then it would also take 2 hours for
    all five shirts to dry, provided they are hung in such a way that they
    receive even sunlight and airflow. Each shirt would dry at the same rate
    as if it were the only shirt being dried. Therefore, the presence of
    additional shirts does not affect the drying time of each individual
    shirt.'
  question: 'If I hang 1 shirt in sunlight it takes approximately 2 hours to
    dry. Assuming 5 shirts all of equal level of wetness hanged at the same
    time and hanged such that they get even sunlight, how long does it take
    for all shirts to dry?'
- answer: 'If each cook can prepare one dish in one hour, and all five cooks
    start preparing the dishes simultaneously, then all five dishes will be
    ready at the same time.\nSince each cook is capable of preparing one dish
    in one hour, and they are all working independently and simultaneously,
    the time it takes for all five dishes to be ready will still be 1 hour.
    Therefore, all five dishes will be ready in 1 hour.'
  question: 'If 1 dish can be prepared in 1 hour. Assuming 5 different
    cooks having equal capabilities and working with separate equipment and
    ingredients start preparing the dish at the same time, how long does it
    take for the 5 dishes to be ready?'
- answer: 'Since each kid is capable of writing the assignment in 30 minutes,
    and they are all working independently and simultaneously, the time it
    takes for all 5 kids to finish the assignment is 30 minutes'
  question: 'If a kid takes 30 minutes to complete an assignment. Assuming 5
    different kids having equal capabilities and writing speed working
    independently. If all kids start at same time how long does it take for
    each of them to complete the assignment?'
- answer: 'Since each painter is capable of painting a room in 45 minutes,
    and they are all working independently and simultaneously, the time it
    takes for all 5 painters to finish painting 5 separate rooms is also
    45 minutes'
  question: 'If it takes 45 minutes for one painter to paint a room. Assuming
    each painter is equally capable and has required equipment to work
    independently, then how long will 5 painters working simultaneously on 5
    separate rooms take to complete the painting?'
- answer: 'Since each worker is capable of assembling a car in 5 hours,
    and they are all working independently and simultaneously, the time it
    takes for all 5 workers to finish assembling 5 separate cars is also
    5 hours'
  question: 'If it takes 5 hours for one worker to assemble a car. Assuming
    each worker is equally capable and working with different setup and
    equipment, then how long will 5 workers working simultaneously on 5
    different cars take to complete the assembling?'
