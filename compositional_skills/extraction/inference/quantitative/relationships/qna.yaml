  - answer: A Grandfather and A grandmother should be considered as 2 whole people
      Grandfather is also a father. It looks like his son also has children
      making him another father. We can conclude Grandfather, Grandmother and
      their son are three people. Grandmother is also a wife and should be
      included in the person count. The second count for a wife, is the wife of
      son. So we can conclude we have a Grandfather, a grandmother, their son
      and his wife. This makes it a total of 4 people present in the party.
    question: At the party there was a grandfather, a grandmother, 2 fathers, 2
      mothers and 2 wives present. Can you Tell how many people were present at
      the party?'
  - answer: A Grandfather and A grandmother should be considered as 2 whole people
      grandfather = 1    grandmother = 1 Grandfather is also a father It looks
      like his son also has children making him another father. Son = 1
      Grandmother is also a wife and should be included in the person count The
      second count for a wife is the wife of the son. Wife = 1 The son is a
      child of the grandfather so he should not be included in the child list.
      This makes the son to have three children Children = 3 A brother and two
      sisters are included in the children so no new person count. Father inlaw
      is already included in the count as Grandfather is the father inlaw for
      the sons wife. Motherinlaw is already included in the count, as the
      Grandmother is also mother in law to the sons wife. Total minimum number
      of people one grandfather + one grandmother + one son + his wife + their
      three children making it 7.
