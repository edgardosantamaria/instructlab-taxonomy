  - question: |
      How can I use awk to print the second column of a text file?
    context: |
      Let's say you have a file named "data.txt" with multiple columns separated by spaces.
      ```
      $ cat data.txt
      1 John Doe
      2 Alice Smith
      3 Bob Johnson
      ```
    answer: |
      You can use awk to print the second column like this:
      ```
      $ awk '{print $2}' data.txt
      John
      Alice
      Bob
      ```
  - question: |
      How do I extract the usernames from the output of the "who" command using awk?
    context: |
      When you run the "who" command, it displays information about currently logged in users.
      ```
      $ who
      user1   tty1  2022-03-10 08:00
      user2   tty2  2022-03-10 08:10
      user3   tty3  2022-03-10 08:15
      ```
    answer: |
      You can extract the usernames using awk like this:
      ```
      $ who | awk '{print $1}'
      user1
      user2
      user3
      ```
  - question: |
      How can I use awk to filter lines containing a specific pattern?
    context: |
      Suppose you have a file named "emails.txt" containing email addresses, and you want to filter out only the lines containing the domain "@example.com".
      ```
      $ cat emails.txt
      user1@example.com
      user2@gmail.com
      user3@example.com
      ```
    answer: |
      You can use awk to filter lines containing "@example.com" like this:
      ```
      $ awk '/@example.com/' emails.txt
      user1@example.com
      user3@example.com
      ```
  - question: |
      How can I use awk to calculate the total of numbers in a column?
    context: |
      Let's say you have a file named "numbers.txt" with numbers in the second column, and you want to calculate their total.
      ```
      $ cat numbers.txt
      A 10
      B 20
      C 30
      ```
    answer: |
      You can use awk to calculate the total of numbers in the second column like this:
      ```
      $ awk '{sum+=$2} END {print sum}' numbers.txt
      60
      ```
  - question: |
      How do I use awk to print lines between two patterns?
    context: |
      Suppose you have a file named "file.txt" with multiple lines, and you want to print lines between the patterns "start" and "end".
      ```
      $ cat file.txt
      line1
      start
      line2
      line3
      end
      line4
      ```
    answer: |
      You can use awk to print lines between "start" and "end" patterns like this:
      ```
      $ awk '/start/, /end/' file.txt
      start
      line2
      line3
      end
      ```
