- answer: 'The trees are planted on the intersection between the horizontal and
    vertical lines. The spacing between the horizontal lines are 10 ft and the
    spacing between the vertical lines 10 ft. If the trees are planted only inside
    the boundary then the calculation of vertical and horizontal lines would be as
    follows. The number of vertical lines would be = (200/10) - 1 = 19. The number
    of horizontal lines would be = 100/10 - 1 = 9. The number of trees would be
    equal to 9 x 19 = 171. Therefore 171 trees could be planted in the rectangular farm.'
  question: 'If trees are planted 10ft apart, then how many trees can be planted
    in an rectanglular plot of length 100 ft and braeadth 200 ft. The trees shall not be
    planted on the boundaries'
  context: 'We have a farm of length 100 ft breadth 200 ft'
- answer: 'The trees are planted on the intersection between the horizontal and
    vertical lines. The spacing between the horizontal lines are 20 ft and the
    spacing between the vertical lines 20 ft. If the trees could be planted on
    the boundaries, then the calculation of the vertical and horizontal lines are as
    follows. The number of vertical lines would be = 1 + (300/20) = 16. The number of horizontal
    lines would be = 1 + 220/20 = 12. The number of trees would be equal to 12 x 16 = 192.
    Therefore 192 trees could be planted in the rectangular farm.'
  question: 'If trees are planted 20ft apart, then how many trees can be planted
    in an rectanglular plot of length 220ft and breadth 300 ft. The trees could be planted on the
    boundaries as well'
  context: 'We have a farm of length 220 ft breadth 300 ft'
- answer: 'The trees are planted on the intersection between the horizontal and
    vertical lines. The spacing between the horizontal lines are 15 ft and the
    spacing between the vertical lines 15 ft. If the trees could be planted on
    the boundaries, then the calculation of the vertical and horizontal lines are as
    follows. The number of vertical lines would be = 1 + (300/15) = 21. The number of horizontal
    lines would be = 1 + (180/15) = 13. The number of trees would be equal to 13 x 21 = 273.
    Therefore 273 trees could be planted in the rectangular farm.'
  question: 'If trees are planted 15 ft apart, then how many trees can be planted
    in an rectanglular plot of length 180 ft and breadth 300 ft. The trees could be planted on the
    boundaries as well'
  context: 'We have a farm of length 180 ft breadth 300 ft'
- answer: 'The trees are planted on the intersection between the horizontal and
    vertical lines. The spacing between the horizontal lines are 25 ft and the
    spacing between the vertical lines 25 ft. If the trees are planted only inside
    the boundary then the calculation of vertical and horizontal lines would be as
    follows. The number of vertical lines would be = (200/25) - 1 = 7. The number
    of horizontal lines would be = 100/25 - 1 = 3. The number of trees would be
    equal to 7 x 3 = 21. Therefore 21 trees could be planted in the rectangular farm.'
  question: 'If trees are planted 25 ft apart, then how many trees can be planted
    in an rectanglular plot of length 100 ft and braeadth 200 ft. The trees shall not be
    planted on the boundaries'
  context: 'We have a farm of length 100 ft breadth 200 ft'
- answer: 'The trees are planted on the intersection between the horizontal and
    vertical lines. The spacing between the horizontal lines are 25 ft and the
    spacing between the vertical lines 25 ft. If the trees could be planted on
    the boundaries, then the calculation of the vertical and horizontal lines are as
    follows. The number of vertical lines would be = 1 + (50/25) = 3. The number of horizontal
    lines would be = 1 + (25/25) = 2. The number of trees would be equal to 3 x 2 = 6.
    Therefore 6 trees could be planted in the rectangular farm.'
  question: 'If trees are planted 25 ft apart, then how many trees can be planted
    in an rectanglular plot of length 25 ft and breadth 50 ft. The trees could be planted on the
    boundaries as well'
  context: 'We have a farm of length 25 ft breadth 50 ft'
task_description: 'Counts the total number of trees planted evenly inside a large rectangle'
