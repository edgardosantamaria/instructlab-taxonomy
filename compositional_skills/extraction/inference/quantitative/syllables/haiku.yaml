- answer: 'This poem has 2 syllables on the first line, 3 on the second, and 3
    on the third. It appears to be an English translation of the well-known
    Japanese haiku by Matsuo Bash≈ç, which has a 5-7-5 pattern of "on", or
    morae. It does not maintain that structure in English syllables, but it
    still evokes the essence of a haiku.'
