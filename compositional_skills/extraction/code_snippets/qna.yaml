    DML Recipe for group by aggregate using Linear Algebra

    Given a matrix PCV as (Position, Category, Value), we sort PCV by category, and within
    each category by value in descending order. Specifically, we create indicator vector
    for category changes, create distinct categories, and perform linear algebra operations.
    Below is the DML script, which we broke up into parts for easy understanding.

    1. Given category and value data, create a matrix with PCV representation

    ```
    C = matrix ('50 40 20 10 30 20 40 20 30', rows = 9, cols = 1)

    V = matrix ('20 11 49 33 94 29 48 74 57', rows = 9, cols = 1)

    PCV = cbind (cbind (seq (1, nrow (C), 1), C), V)
    ```

    2. Sort PCV by category, and within each category by value

    ```
    PCV = order (target = PCV, by = 3, decreasing = TRUE,  index.return = FALSE)

    PCV = order (target = PCV, by = 2, decreasing = FALSE, index.return = FALSE)
    ```

    3. Find all rows of PCV where the category has a new value, in comparison to
    the previous row

    ```
    is_new_C = matrix (1, rows = 1, cols = 1);

    if (nrow (C) > 1) {

      is_new_C = rbind (is_new_C, (PCV [1:nrow(C) - 1, 2] < PCV [2:nrow(C), 2]));  }
    ```

    4. Associate each category with its index

    ```
    index_C = cumsum (is_new_C);
    ```

    5. For each category, compute:

    * the list of distinct categories

    * the maximum value for each category

    * 0-1 aggregation matrix that adds records of the same category

    ```
    distinct_C  = removeEmpty (target = PCV [, 2], margin = "rows", select = is_new_C);

    max_V_per_C = removeEmpty (target = PCV [, 3], margin = "rows", select = is_new_C);

    C_indicator = table (index_C, PCV [, 1], max (index_C), nrow (C));
    ```

    6. Perform aggregation, here sum values per category

    ```
    sum_V_per_C = C_indicator %*% V
    ```
  question: >
    Based on the provided document, can you write a DML script for group by aggregation?
  answer: >
    Yes, here is the DML script for group by aggregation, which has been broken
    up into parts for easy understanding:

    1. Given category and value data, create a matrix with PCV representation

    ```
    C = matrix ('50 40 20 10 30 20 40 20 30', rows = 9, cols = 1)

    PCV = cbind (cbind (seq (1, nrow (C), 1), C), V)
    ```

    2. Sort PCV by category, and within each category by value

    ```
    PCV = order (target = PCV, by = 3, decreasing = TRUE,  index.return = FALSE)

    PCV = order (target = PCV, by = 2, decreasing = FALSE, index.return = FALSE)
    ```

    3. Find all rows of PCV where the category has a new value, in comparison to
    the previous row

    ```
    is_new_C = matrix (1, rows = 1, cols = 1);

    if (nrow (C) > 1) {

      is_new_C = rbind (is_new_C, (PCV [1:nrow(C) - 1, 2] < PCV [2:nrow(C), 2]));  }
    ```

    4. Associate each category with its index

    ```
    index_C = cumsum (is_new_C);
    ```

    5. For each category, compute:

    * the list of distinct categories

    * the maximum value for each category

    * 0-1 aggregation matrix that adds records of the same category

    ```
    distinct_C  = removeEmpty (target = PCV [, 2], margin = "rows", select = is_new_C);

    max_V_per_C = removeEmpty (target = PCV [, 3], margin = "rows", select = is_new_C);

    C_indicator = table (index_C, PCV [, 1], max (index_C), nrow (C));
    ```

    6. Perform aggregation, here sum values per category

    ```
    sum_V_per_C = C_indicator %*% V
    ```

    Here is a diagnostic dichotomous key that you can use to identify Eutopiforma UVW
    trees and differentiate them from several other Eutopiforma species:
