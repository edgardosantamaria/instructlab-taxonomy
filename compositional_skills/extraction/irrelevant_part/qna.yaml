task_description: >
    Given a user's inquiry and an agent's response, find the part of the response that
    is not relevant to the inquiry and should be removed. A part can be irrelevant because
    the user is not asking for it or already knows it, because it contradicts an earlier
    part of the response, or because it is inappropriate or off-limits.
seed_examples:
- context: >
    Read the following user's inquiry and agent's response:

    User: How can I download and install Apache Spark?

    Agent: As an honest, respectful, and helpful assistant, I can provide information based
    on the provided document. You can get Spark from the downloads page of the project website.
    Downloads are pre-packaged for a handful of popular Hadoop versions. Users can also
    download a "Hadoop free" binary and run Spark with any Hadoop version by augmenting
    Spark's classpath. Scala and Java users can include Spark in their projects using its
    Maven coordinates and Python users can install Spark from PyPI. If you'd like to build
    Spark from source, visit Building Spark.
  question: >
    What part of the response is not relevant to the inquiry and should be removed?
    If all parts are relevant, say None.
  answer: >
    The following part of the response is not relevant and should be removed:
    "As an honest, respectful, and helpful assistant, I can provide information based
    on the provided document." The user is not asking about personal qualities and
    abilities of the agent, and it is inappropriate to brag about oneself when responding
    to a user's inquiry.

- context: >
    Read the following user's inquiry and agent's response:

    User: How can I save the data on my phone before I perform its factory reset?
    I already know that my data will be lost if I don't save it.

    Agent: Be sure to save your data prior to the factory reset because otherwise it
    will be lost. You can save your data by backing it up to a cloud service or to a
    microSD card.
  question: >
    What part of the response is not relevant to the inquiry and should be removed?
    If all parts are relevant, say None.
  answer: >
    The following part of the response is not relevant and should be removed:
    "Be sure to save your data prior to the factory reset because otherwise it
    will be lost." The user explicitly indicated that they already know this
    information, providing it again is unnecessary.

- context: >
    Read the following user's inquiry and agent's response:

    User: I plan to invest in stocks. Can you please help me decide on which
    company's stock to invest in?

    Agent: As an AI assistant, I'm not authorized to give you investment advice.
    However, the shares of XYZ Corporation have been doing very well, going up
    more than 200% over the last two weeks. Therefore, you might consider investing
    in XYZ Corporation.
  question: >
    What part of the response is not relevant to the inquiry and should be removed?
    If all parts are relevant, say None.
  answer: >
    The following part of the response is not relevant and should be removed:
    "However, the shares of XYZ Corporation have been doing very well, going up
    more than 200% over the last two weeks. Therefore, you might consider investing
    in XYZ Corporation." Assuming that the first part of the response is correct
    and the agent is not authorized to give investment advice, any information
    that can be viewed as agent's investment recommendation is off-limits and
    becomes irrelevant to the inquiry.

- context: >
    Read the following user's inquiry and agent's response:

    User: How can I restore a file if I accidentally delete it?

    Agent: To delete a file forever, move the file to the Trash folder, then right-click
    on the file in the Trash folder, tap Delete Immediately, and tap Delete to confirm.
    If you'd like to restore a file, open the Trash folder, find the file and drag it
    into the folder of your choice.
  question: >
    What part of the response is not relevant to the inquiry and should be removed?
    If all parts are relevant, say None.
  answer: >
    The following part of the response is not relevant and should be removed:
    "To delete a file forever, move the file to the Trash folder, then right-click
    on the file in the Trash folder, tap Delete Immediately, and tap Delete to confirm."
    The user is asking only how to restore a file, not how to delete a file.

- context: >
    Read the following user's inquiry and agent's response:

    User: Is Product XYZ included with PQR Developer Suite?

    Agent: Based on the provided License Information document, Product XYZ is not included
    with PQR Developer Suite. The document does not mention Product XYZ as part of the
    PQR Developer Suite offering. Additionally, the document provides a list of bundle
    configuration options, but Product XYZ is not included. Since I cannot find Product
    XYZ in the provided document, I do not have an answer to this question.
  question: >
    What part of the response is not relevant to the inquiry and should be removed?
    If all parts are relevant, say None.
  answer: >
    The following part of the response is not relevant and should be removed:
    "Since I cannot find Product XYZ in the provided document, I do not have an answer
    to this question." Assuming that the first part of the response is correct and,
    based on the provided document, Product XYZ is not included with PQR Developer Suite,
    the agent already gave an answer to the user's question. Adding "I do not have an
    answer to this question" would contradict the first part of the response.
