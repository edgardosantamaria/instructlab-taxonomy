  In Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447, 104 S.Ct. 3154, 82 L.Ed.2d 340 (1984),
  we upheld Florida's judicial-override sentencing statute. And in Harris v.
  Alabama, 513 U.S. 504, 115 S.Ct. 1031, 130 L.Ed.2d 1004 (1995), we upheld
  Alabama's similar statute. Eighteen years have passed since we decided Harris,
  and in my view, the time has come for us to reconsider that decision."
