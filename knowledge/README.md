# Instructlab (LAB) Knowledge 

Knowledge consists of data and facts and is backed by documents. When you create knowledge for a model, you're giving it additional data to more accurately answer questions. The knowledge document formats currently supported are markdown (.md) and text (.txt).

[See taxonomy readme.md](https://github.com/instruct-lab/taxonomy?tab=readme-ov-file#knowledge) for more details.

## Augmenting Knowledge in the Model - Data Sources
A number of data sources were used to augment the model and generate InstructLab artifacts. You can find a list of data sources in the [Community repository](https://github.com/instruct-lab/community/blob/main/docs/DataSources.md).
