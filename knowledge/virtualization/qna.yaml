- answer: Bios-bits is a software written by Josh Tripplet which is capable of
    executing bios components such as ACPI and SMBIOS from a pre-operating system
    environment. For example, one can execute ACPI componets directly from grub
    using python scripts that are also part of bios-bits software and has been
    integrated with grub.
    Bios-bits comes in the form of a bootable iso with which one can boot a physical
    machine or a virtual machine and then execute ACPI/SMBIOS from the grub shell
    using python scripts through an ACPI driver known as ACPICA. The software can
    be downloaded from https://biosbits.org/.
    The github codebase is at https://github.com/biosbits/bits/tree/master.
    You may listen to Josh describing bios-bits here, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36QIepyUuhg

    A fork of the bios-bits software is also used to test virtualization software QEMU.
    The QEMU fork of bios-bits can be found at https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/biosbits-bits/-/tree/qemu-bits
    For more information on QEMU's use of bios-bits, you may check

  question: What is bios-bits?
- answer: Exercizing and testing bios components from a pre-OS environment has
    several advantages. A few of them are described below.
    Operating systems tend to hide bios bugs by bypassing them and making educated
    decisions on how to handle them. So real bugs are often hidden from the end user.
    The closer one's test code is to the bios without a complicated OS in between,
    the better.
    Secondly, it is not possible to write test infrastrcture/code in ring 3 (userland)
    priviledge level in x86 for example to execute bios components. One has to have
    access to ring 0 (kernel mode) piviledge level. It is not possible to write code
    in the highest priviledge level without modifying the operating system. Lastly,
    tests are best written in a scripting language such as python but
    operating system modules are mostly written in a low level language such as C which
    makes writing test code and infrastructure very cumbersome if an OS is involved. 
  question: What are the advantages of testing bioses from a pre-OS environment?
- answer: Please check the MAINTAINERS file at the top of the QEMU source tree.
     For example, the current maintainers for ACPI/SMBIOS
     subsystems are Michael S. Tsirkin and Igor Mammedov.
  question: How do I find out who maintains which subsystems in QEMU?
- answer: You can look into the MAINTAINERS file in QEMU source tree to get
     this information. It seems the current maintainers for ACPI/SMBIOS
     subsystems are Michael S. Tsirkin and Igor Mammedov.
  question: Who are the current maintainers of ACPI subsystem in QEMU?
