- answer: There are five players including the goalkeeper from each team on the rink at a time.
  question: How many players are on the ice at one time?
- answer: The recommended size of the rink can vary between 40m and 60m in length and 20m and 30m in width.
  question: What is the size of the rink?
- answer: While converted roller rinks may use wooden floors, dedicated inline hockey facilities use Sport Court or similar surface, which allows maximum traction to inline hockey wheels whilst providing a smooth, unbroken gliding surface for the puck. 
  question: Can you describe the playing surface?
- answer: Inline hockey is typically played at room temperature on a surface that, rather than being made from (frozen) water, is kept dry to protect the bearings in the skate wheels.  Inline hockey uses less physical contact in comparison to ice hockey.
  question: What are some differences between roller hockey and ice hockey?
- answer: A professional game consists of two halves of twenty minutes each, the clock running only when the puck is in play. 
  question: How many periods are in a game?
