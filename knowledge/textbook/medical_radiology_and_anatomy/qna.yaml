- answer: 'The cranial nerves that are purely motor in function are the oculomotor
    (CN III), trochlear (CN IV), abducens (CN VI), and hypoglossal (CN XII) nerves.
    These nerves emerge from the brainstem in the following locations:


    * Oculomotor Nerves (CN III): They emerge from the interpeduncular fossa.

    * Trochlear Nerves (CN IV): They emerge from the dorsal aspect of the midbrain.

    * Abducens Nerves (CN VI): They emerge near the midline at the border of the pons
    and the medulla oblongata.

    * Hypoglossal Nerves (CN XII): They emerge from the ventral aspect of the caudal
    medulla as a series of rootlets.'
  question: Which cranial nerves are purely motor in function and where do they emerge
    from the brainstem?
- answer: The extraocular muscles of the eye are six muscles that control eye movement.
    They include the lateral rectus, which moves the eye laterally (outward); the
    medial rectus, which moves the eye medially (inward); the inferior rectus, which
    moves the eye inferiorly (downward); the superior rectus, which moves the eye
    superiorly (upward); and the inferior oblique and superior oblique, which allow
    for torsional movement and help with convergence and divergence.
  question: What are the extraocular muscles of the eye and what are their actions?
- answer: The primary auditory cortex is located in the superior temporal gyrus. Its
    function is to process general sensory information related to hearing.
  question: What is the primary auditory cortex located in, and what is its function?
