- answer: Proprietary relicensing can present several issues for open source projects.
    First, it may limit the project's accessibility and freedom, as the software is
    no longer freely available for modification and distribution. Additionally, proprietary
    relicensing can create legal complexities and potential conflicts with existing
    open source licenses. It may also limit the community's involvement, as contributors
    may be unwilling to work on a project that could eventually be closed off from
    the public.
  question: What are some potential issues with proprietary relicensing in open source
    projects?
- answer: Transparency and verifiability in open source software development refer
    to the ability of the public to access, review, and confirm the accuracy of claims
    made by organizations involved in open source projects. This includes verifying
    the results of community testing, tracking the history of code changes, and providing
    credit to contributors. The idea is to maintain openness, honesty, and accuracy
    in representing project progress and community involvement, as the actions and
    claims of organizations are easily checked and scrutinized by experts within the
    open source community.
  question: What is the concept of transparency and verifiability in the context of
    open source software development?
- answer: Providing build farms and development servers in open source projects is
    important because many projects have infrastructure needs beyond just hosting
    of code and bug trackers. Build farms, which automatically ensure that changes
    developers are committing integrate cleanly into the main branch and pass all
    automated tests, can be expensive to run. Donating server space, bandwidth, and
    technical expertise to set up and maintain the continuous integration and automated
    testing can help the project and gain goodwill in the process.

    in open source projects?
