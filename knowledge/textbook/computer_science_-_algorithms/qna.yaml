- answer: 'Selection Sort and Insertion Sort are both simple sorting algorithms with
    similar time complexities, but they have different high-level approaches.


    Selection Sort:

    Selection Sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted
    part of the list and putting it at the beginning of the sorted part. Here''s a
    high-level description of the algorithm:


    1. Start at the beginning of the list.

    2. Find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the list.

    3. Swap the minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part.

    4. Move one position down the list (from the first to the second element in the
    unsorted part).

    5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the remaining unsorted part of the list.


    Selection Sort has a worst-case and average-case time complexity of O(n^2), where
    n is the number of items being sorted.


    Insertion Sort:

    Insertion Sort works by iteratively building a sorted list from the beginning
    of the input list. Here''s a high-level description of the algorithm:


    1. Start at the second element of the list.

    2. Compare the current element with the previous element.

    3. If the current element is smaller, shift the previous element and all elements
    to its right one position to the right.

    4. Insert the current element in the vacated position.

    5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the remaining elements in the list.


    Insertion Sort has a worst-case and average-case time complexity of O(n^2) when
    the input list is in reverse order. However, for nearly sorted lists, Insertion
    Sort can perform better than Selection Sort, with a time complexity close to O(n).'
  question: What is the difference between selection sort and insertion sort? Describe
    their high-level approaches and time complexities.
- answer: The primary challenge in solving NP-complete problems is that they often
    have worst-case exponential time complexity, making them infeasible to solve quickly
    using brute force. Finding an approximate solution is important because it can
    provide a useful, albeit not fully correct, solution to the problem in a more
    practical timeframe.
  question: What is the primary challenge in solving NP-complete problems, and why
    is finding an approximate solution important?
- answer: The time complexity of removing a node from a linked list is O(n), where
    n is the length of the linked list.
