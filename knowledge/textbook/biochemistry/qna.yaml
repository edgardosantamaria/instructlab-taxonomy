- answer: Bugbuster reagent is used in cell lysis to disrupt the cell membrane and
    release the contents, including the protein of interest. It is considered a gentle
    method because it uses lysozyme and lipases/detergents to dissolve the cell membrane,
    which is less likely to damage the protein compared to other methods such as sonication
    or French press.
  question: What is the purpose of using Bugbuster reagent in cell lysis and why is
    it considered a gentle method?
- answer: 'Completing the lab/partner/self evaluation Google form is important to
    assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the lab, the performance of the lab
    partners, and the learning outcomes of the lab. The information typically collected
    in such a form includes:


    * The overall satisfaction with the lab, the lab procedures, and the lab equipment.

    * The level of understanding of the lab concepts, the lab procedures, and the
    lab results.

    * The level of collaboration and communication with the lab partners, the TAs,
    and the instructors.

    * The level of independence and responsibility in carrying out the lab procedures,
    following the lab protocol, and documenting the lab results.

    * The potential areas for improvement, the potential challenges, and the potential
    solutions.'
  question: What is the purpose of completing the lab/partner/self evaluation Google
    form, and what information is typically collected in such a form?
- answer: The purpose of using the restriction enzyme DpnI in the Gibson assembly
    process is to eliminate template plasmids that are not the desired clones. DpnI
    recognizes and cuts methylated DNA, which is present in the template plasmids
    from E. coli. PCR products, however, will not be methylated and will not be digested
    by DpnI.
  question: What is the purpose of using the restriction enzyme DpnI in the Gibson
    assembly process?
