- answer: The 'for' loop in Python is a fixed-iteration loop that iterates over a
    sequence or an iterable object, executing a specific number of times. The 'while'
    loop, on the other hand, is a variable-iteration loop that continues executing
    as long as a specified condition is true. The 'while' loop is more flexible but
    also more prone to errors due to the need for explicit condition management.
  question: What is the difference between the 'for' loop and the 'while' loop in
    Python?
- answer: Deductive reasoning is based on irrefutable logic, deriving new facts from
    known facts, while machine learning is based on inductive reasoning, looking at
    lots and lots of past examples to make future predictions based on them.
  question: What is the difference between deductive reasoning and machine learning?
- answer: The value_counts() method helps in understanding the target variable by
    providing the count of each unique value in the target variable. In the videogame
    business example, it shows that there are 10 students with the value 'N' (not
    a gamer) and 7 students with the value 'Y' (gamer) in the VG column.
  question: How does the value_counts() method help in understanding the target variable
    in the videogame business example?
