- answer: The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer
    system that performs most of the processing inside the computer. It works closely
    with static random access memory (SRAM), which is a type of random access memory
    (RAM) that doesn't need to be refreshed and is faster than dynamic random access
    memory (DRAM). SRAM serves as a system cache that stores frequently used data
    and instructions, allowing the CPU to access them more quickly and efficiently.
    The CPU processes the information stored in SRAM, executing instructions and performing
    calculations as needed.
  question: Explain the role of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) in a computer system
    and how it works with static random access memory (SRAM).
- answer: Connecting one jumper wire at a time will light up one color of the LED.
    Connecting two jumper wires at a time will light up two colors, and connecting
    all three will light up all three colors. The brightness of the LED may change
    depending on the number of circuits plugged into a USB hub or the type of USB
    port used on a laptop or other power source.
  question: How does the number of jumper wires connected between the resistors and
    ground affect the LED's behavior?
- answer: Private IP addresses are used for internal network communication and cannot
    be routed through the public Internet. In the simple_uartWebserverLED Python program,
    the private IP address of the Raspberry Pi is used to establish communication
    between the web browser and the Python program running on the Raspberry Pi.
  question: What are private IP addresses and how are they related to the simple_uartWebserverLED
    Python program?
