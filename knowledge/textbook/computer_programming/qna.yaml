- answer: In programming, 'Chained Mutators' are used to chain multiple method calls
    together, where each method call modifies the object it is called on. This is
    often used in operations where multiple attributes of an object need to be modified
    in a single statement.
  question: What is the purpose of 'Chained Mutators' in beginning programming?
- answer: The output of the method 'checkFor' in this case would be 'true' because
    all elements in the 'checklist' array have been accomplished.
  question: What is the output of the method 'checkFor' if the 'checklist' array contains
    the elements ['Shirts', 'Socks', 'Pants', 'Skirts'] and the 'accomplished' array
    contains the elements ['Socks', 'Shirts', 'Pants', 'Skirts']?
- answer: 'Bit Flags are binary values, often used in programming to indicate the
    current or desired state of a system. They can be useful in managing a large number
    of binary states, such as items in a game inventory. Bit flags take advantage
    of the fact that everything in a digital computer is stored as 0s and 1s. A non-negative
    integer can be used to hold multiple binary flags by utilizing the &, |, and ^
    operators for bitwise ''and'', ''inclusive or'', and ''exclusive or'' operations.


    The process of implementing bit flags involves creating masks for binary states
    of interest, declaring a variable to hold the bit flags, setting or clearing specific
    bits using bitwise operators, and checking the value of particular bits as needed.
    This approach can help reduce the number of variables and simplify the management
    of binary states in a program.'
  question: What is the concept of 'Bit Flags' in programming and how can they be
    used to manage and perform operations on binary states?
