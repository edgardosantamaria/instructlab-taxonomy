- answer: 'The four pointer types explored for libpmemobj are:


    1. 8-byte offset pointer (relative to the beginning of the pool) - Quickly ruled
    out because it did not satisfy the second requirement and needed a pool base pointer
    to be provided to the translation method.

    2. 8-byte self-relative pointers - Potentially the fastest implementation, but
    it does not satisfy the second basic requirement, and it would require a special
    assignment method.

    3. 8-byte offset pointers with embedded memory pool identifier - Satisfies the
    second requirement but has a relatively small number of bits for the pool identifier,
    which might shrink with future hardware.

    4. 16-byte fat offset pointer with pool identifier - Provides the best utility,
    at the cost of space overhead and some runtime performance.


    libpmemobj uses the most generic approach of the 16-byte offset pointer, allowing
    users to make their own choice since all other pointer types can be directly derived
    from it.'
  question: What are the four pointer types explored for libpmemobj, and what are
    their advantages and disadvantages?
- answer: 'Libpmemobj supports two types of direct access platforms: ADR (Asynchronous
    DRAM Refresh) and eADR (enhanced Asynchronous DRAM Refresh). The main difference
    between these platforms lies in how they handle data persistence. On an eADR platform,
    where CPU caches are considered persistent, no further action is required to ensure
    data persistence, as any data written will be considered persistent. This results
    in a significant performance optimization. However, on an ADR platform, the most
    optimal flush operation must be identified based on Intel machine instructions
    to ensure data persistence.'
  question: What are the two types of direct access platforms supported by libpmemobj,
    and how do they differ in terms of handling data persistence?
- answer: The main principle behind traditional volatile memory allocators is efficient
    management of operating system-provided memory pages, aiming to minimize heap
    fragmentation by exploiting regularities in allocation and deallocation patterns.
