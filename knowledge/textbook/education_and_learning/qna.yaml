- answer: Collaboration is an essential component of active learning, as it promotes
    social interaction, communication, and cooperation among learners. Collaboration
    helps learners to construct knowledge through dialogue, negotiation, and co-construction
    of meaning. By promoting shared responsibility, mutual support, and collective
    intelligence, collaboration contributes to meaningful learning experiences by
    increasing learner engagement, motivation, and satisfaction. Collaborative learning
    experiences can take many forms, including group projects, peer teaching, team-based
    learning, and online discussions.
  question: What is the role of collaboration in active learning, and how does it
    promote meaningful learning experiences?
- answer: Assessment in a blended learning course plays a crucial role in measuring
    the achievement of learning outcomes. It should be congruent with the intended
    learning outcomes and provide feedback to both the students and the instructor
    about the effectiveness of the instruction and the level of student understanding.
    Assessment can take many forms, including formative assessments, summative assessments,
    self-assessments, and peer assessments. By providing opportunities for students
    to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, assessment contributes to the achievement
    of learning outcomes by promoting accountability, motivation, and engagement.
  question: What is the role of assessment in a blended learning course, and how does
    it contribute to the achievement of learning outcomes?
- answer: The primary components of a blended learning environment include fostering
    a student-centered approach, promoting student-student and student-instructor
    interaction, setting clear expectations, and linking the online environment to
    the face-to-face classroom. These components can be applied at the activity, lesson,
    module, or entire course design level. The seven principles of blended learning
    (design for open communication & trust, critical reflection & discourse, sense
    of community, purposeful inquiry, sustained collaboration, inquiry to resolution,
    and assessment congruent with intended learning outcomes) can be integrated into
    these components as much as is appropriate. By doing so, instructors can create
    a more engaging and effective blended learning experience for students.
  question: What are the primary components of a blended learning environment, and
    how can the seven principles of blended learning be integrated into these components?
