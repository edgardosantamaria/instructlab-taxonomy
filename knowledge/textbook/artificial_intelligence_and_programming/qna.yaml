- answer: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the use of computers, algorithms,
    and sometimes external data to solve problems that an ideally rational and intelligent
    human being could solve, given the time, resources, and ingenuity. AI systems
    are typically designed to perform specific tasks or solve particular problems.


    Artificial general intelligence (AGI), on the other hand, is a non-human mechanism
    that demonstrates a broad range of problem-solving, creativity, and adaptability.
    AGI systems can independently transfer knowledge and skills from one domain to
    another, understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can do,
    and can make decisions and solve problems autonomously in a wide range of complex
    situations. AGI is a more advanced and generalized form of AI, which does not
    yet exist but is a topic of ongoing research and development.'
  question: What is the difference between artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial
    general intelligence (AGI)?
- answer: Dictionaries and supplementary rules are used in machine translation to
    help the system make judgements about the best translation. These resources provide
    additional information that can help the system understand the meaning and context
    of the text being translated.
  question: What is the role of dictionaries and supplementary rules in machine translation,
    as discussed in the document?
- answer: Ignoring 'literary warrant' in the development of a controlled vocabulary
    (CV) for a specific domain could result in a CV that is not representative of
    the state of knowledge in the field. This could lead to a CV that is outdated,
    inaccurate, or irrelevant, reducing its usefulness and value to users. By taking
    into account the actual published literature in the field, AI algorithms can create
    a CV that is up-to-date, relevant, and accurate, ensuring that it meets the needs
    and expectations of its users.
  question: What is the potential impact of ignoring 'literary warrant' in the development
    of a controlled vocabulary for a specific domain?
