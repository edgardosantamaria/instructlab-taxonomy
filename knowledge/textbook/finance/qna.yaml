- answer: 'When a business collects sales tax from customers, the Sales Tax Payable
    account is increased. The journal entry to record a sale for cash with 8% sales
    tax would involve debiting Cash for the total amount of the sale (including sales
    tax), crediting Sales for the sale price excluding sales tax, and crediting Sales
    Tax Payable for the amount of sales tax collected.


    For example, if a business sells a product for $100 plus 8% sales tax, the journal
    entry would be:


    Date | Account | Debit | Credit

    --- | --- | --- | ---

    20b | Cash | $108 |

    | Sales | | $100 |

    | Sales Tax Payable | | $8 |'
  question: What is the impact on the Sales Tax Payable account when a business collects
    sales tax from customers? Provide an example of a journal entry to record a sale
    for cash with 8% sales tax.
- answer: 'The matching principle in accounting is a fundamental accounting concept
    that requires recognizing revenues and expenses in the same accounting period.
    This principle ensures that financial statements accurately reflect the performance
    of a business during a specific period.


    Closing entries directly support the matching principle by transferring the balances
    of revenue and expense accounts to Retained Earnings at the end of an accounting
    period. This process ensures that revenues and expenses are reported in the same
    period, adhering to the matching principle.


    For example, if a company earns $5,000 in revenue and incurs $3,000 in expenses
    during a given period, the matching principle requires that both amounts be reported
    in the same income statement. Closing entries facilitate this by resetting the
    revenue and expense account balances to zero, while simultaneously updating Retained
    Earnings to reflect the net income or loss for the period.'
  question: What is the matching principle in accounting and how does it relate to
    the closing entries process?
- answer: 'The purpose of the adjusting entry for prepaid rent is to recognize the
    portion of prepaid rent that has expired and should be reported as rent expense
    for the current accounting period. This adjusting entry helps ensure that the
    financial statements accurately reflect the company''s financial position and
    activities.


    The adjusting entry for prepaid rent impacts both the balance sheet and the income
    statement. On the balance sheet, the adjusting entry reduces the amount of prepaid
    rent and updates the account to reflect the correct, up-to-date amount of unexpired
    prepaid rent, which remains an asset. On the income statement, the adjusting entry
    increases the Rent Expense account, reflecting the actual rent expense incurred
    during the period.


    For example, if a company has prepaid $12,000 for rent for a year, after one month,
    $1,000 of the prepaid rent has expired and should be recognized as rent expense.
    The adjusting entry would transfer $1,000 from the Prepaid Rent account to the
    Rent Expense account. As a result, the balance sheet will show $11,000 in unexpired
    prepaid rent, and the income statement will report $1,000 in rent expense for
    the current period.'
  question: What is the purpose of the adjusting entry for prepaid rent, and how does
    it impact the financial statements of a company?
