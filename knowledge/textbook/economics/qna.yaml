- answer: The neoclassical model may not be as effective in explaining short-term
    fluctuations in unemployment because it focuses on the underlying determinants
    of output and employment in markets, which may not capture the short-term effects
    of changes in aggregate demand or wage and price rigidity. The short-term Keynesian
    model, on the other hand, places more emphasis on these factors, which can help
    explain why unemployment moves up and down over short time horizons.
  question: What are the main reasons why the neoclassical model may not be as effective
    in explaining short-term fluctuations in unemployment compared to the short-term
    Keynesian model?
- answer: The price of a substitute good can affect the demand for a product because
    when the price of a substitute good changes, consumers may alter their consumption
    patterns. If the price of a substitute good decreases, consumers may find it more
    attractive and buy less of the original good, causing a decrease in demand for
    the original good. Conversely, if the price of a substitute good increases, consumers
    may find the original good more attractive and buy more of it, causing an increase
    in demand for the original good.
  question: Explain how the price of a substitute good can affect the demand for a
    product.
- answer: If the government imposes a tax on cigarettes, the price of cigarettes will
    increase and the quantity of cigarettes in the market will decrease, according
    to the law of supply and demand. This is because the tax increases the cost of
    production for producers, putting upward pressure on the price and reducing the
    quantity supplied. The higher price also reduces the quantity demanded, further
    reducing the quantity in the market.
  question: Suppose the government imposes a tax on cigarettes. How will this affect
    the price and quantity of cigarettes in the market, according to the law of supply
    and demand?
