- answer: 'The Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) specification is a set
    of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to improve the accessibility
    of dynamic, interactive web content. ARIA provides a way to communicate the role,
    state, and properties of these elements to assistive technologies, such as screen
    readers, so that users with disabilities can better understand and interact with
    them.


    For example, ARIA can be used to define custom widgets, such as sliders or tabs,
    that may not be natively supported by HTML. It can also be used to provide additional
    context and information about elements, such as the current value of a progress
    bar or the selected item in a list.


    ARIA is an important tool for making complex, dynamic web content more accessible,
    and is an essential part of WCAG 2.0 and other accessibility standards.'
  question: What is the purpose of the "Accessible Rich Internet Applications" (ARIA)
    specification in the context of web accessibility?
- answer: Users may opt for free open-source screen readers like NVDA or Talkback
    for web accessibility testing because they are often more affordable and accessible
    to a wider audience, and they have been gaining users due to improvements in their
    functionality.
  question: What are some of the reasons why users may opt for free open-source screen
    readers like NVDA or Talkback for web accessibility testing?
- answer: The 'talk aloud protocol' is a method used in user testing to gather information
    about a user's experience using a web content or application. It involves having
    the user verbalize their thoughts, actions, and emotions as they complete tasks.
    This method helps the observer understand the user's thought process and identify
    any issues or difficulties they encounter during testing.
