- answer: The change of base formula used for computing logarithms in C is log(x)
    / log(b), where x is the number, b is the base, and log is the natural logarithm
    function.
  question: What is the change of base formula used for computing logarithms in C?
- answer: Stability in sorting algorithms refers to the property that the relative
    order of equal elements is preserved during the sorting process. This is important
    in some applications because it can affect the correctness and efficiency of subsequent
    operations on the sorted data. The design of a comparator can affect the stability
    of a sorting algorithm because the comparator determines how elements are compared
    and ordered. If the comparator does not properly handle equal elements, the sorting
    algorithm may not be stable. For example, if the comparator returns a random value
    for equal elements, the sorting algorithm may produce different results on different
    runs, which can be problematic for some applications.
  question: Explain the concept of stability in sorting algorithms, and how it relates
    to the design of a comparator.
- answer: A deep copy of an array creates a new array and copies all the elements
    from the original array to the new one. This is different from a shallow copy,
    where only the references to the elements are copied, not the elements themselves.
    A deep copy is useful when you want to modify the new array without affecting
    the original one. To create a deep copy, you can iterate over the original array
    and add each element to the new array one by one.
  question: Describe the purpose and process of creating a deep copy of an array in
    programming.
