- answer: In the context of a birth-death process, the fact that the probability of
    a transition from one state to another is proportional to the current state means
    that the rate of change of the population is directly proportional to the current
    population size. This is a key characteristic of the birth-death process.
  question: In the context of a birth-death process, what is the significance of the
    fact that the probability of a transition from one state to another is proportional
    to the current state?
- answer: In a Markov Chain, a chain is said to be finite if it has a finite number
    of states, and infinite if it has an infinite number of states. A finite Markov
    Chain is often represented by a finite transition matrix, while an infinite Markov
    Chain is represented by an infinite transition matrix.
  question: What is the difference between a finite and an infinite Markov Chain?
- answer: The row echelon form is an intermediate step in Gaussian elimination where
    the matrix has zeros in the lower left triangle. This form makes it easier to
    find solutions to the system of equations represented by the matrix.
  question: What is the purpose of the row echelon form in Gaussian elimination?
