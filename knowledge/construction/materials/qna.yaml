    Cement is a building material that hardens and sticks to other materials. 
    The most common type of cement used is called Portland cement, 
    which is made by heating limestone and clay and then adding gypsum.
  question: What is cement?

    Concrete is a special construction material formed by mixing water, cement
    and small and large pieces like gravel, crushed stone or recycled concrete.
  question: How to create concrete?
- answer: |
    Concrete is strong under compression, but has low tensile strength.
    Once the load on an unreinforced concrete slab or structure reaches a critical point,
    tension cracks begin to show, and the structure will eventually fail.You give the structure
    tensile strength when you place rebar and/or steel mesh in the formwork before the concrete
    is poured. The reinforcement bars transfer the pull (tensile), push (compression)
    and slide (shear) loads between the rebar and concrete.
  question: Why do we need rebars (reinforcing bars) in concrete?
- answer: |
    Brick is typically made from clay that's fired in a kiln. 
  question: From what is a brick made of?
- answer: |
    Mortar is comprised of various ratios of mason sand, portland cement, hydrated lime, and water
    depending on application. A special type of mortar, called thinset, is used as an adhesive
    to install ceramic and stone tile.
  question: What is mortar made of?
- answer: |
    Glass is made from liquid sand. You can make glass by heating ordinary sand until it melts and turns into a liquid.
    Sand melts at the temperature of 1700°C (3090°F).
