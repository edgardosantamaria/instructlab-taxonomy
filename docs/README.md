## Review Process
The review process starts with contributor drafting the PR.
1. At the PR stage, reviewers would manually check its contents (e.g. making sure the examples are added to the correct path, inspecting the contents of examples; full list TBD).
    - If not valid, go back to the contributor and ask them to take actions.
2. If a PR passes step 1, the SDG will be triggered to generate synthetic data samples.
    - If not valid, go back to the contributor and ask them to take actions.
3. If step 2 passes, it will be used in the next model update.
